            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ARTHENOPE being one of the principal Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> enjoys a Heaven which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo clement, that its nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vext with the exceſſes of the Froſts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48268:5"/>in Winter, nor of the heats of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: She kindly affords the <hi>Tyrene</hi> Sea her breaſts, who being not ingrate makes profitable returns, and enricheth her with pleaſures: Plenty feaſts at all times in the fields of its territory, and delight, triumphs in ſuch a manner, that Heaven, the Sea, and the Earth ſeem rivals in rendring this City beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers incomparably wonderful. Its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by very tractable people, yet cunning and of a quick wit for inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It breeds a many Cavaliers, amongſt whom one of the firſt was called <hi>Octavio Franci</hi> a noble man, conſpicuous for wealth, and illuſtrious for his valor and perſon: He as the onely One was brought up with carreſſes, which uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſeth mindes to the love of luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whence he hardly had compleated his third luſter, but he ſubmits himſelf to the Tyrany of Love. <hi>Florida Albinelli</hi> dwelt neer his houſe, a Lady of a great birth, but of a ſlender fortune; her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loving appearance more then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, having vainly conſum'd thoſe riches which maintain titles and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Florida</hi> was as liberally priviledged by nature, as ſhe was hardly perſecuted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48268:5"/>by Fortune; She had ſuch beauties, that the attributes of celeſtial and divine ſeem'd rather proper then Hyperboly. With theſe prerogatives ſhe daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd ſuch a number of Sutors as <hi>Penelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi> never had ſo many wooers: Neither could any other Egyptian Lady boaſt of more lovers: but amongſt the crowd of her ſervants none was more paſſionate, and more hearty then our <hi>Octavio.</hi> He a long while courted her as a neighbour, &amp; then beholds her as the Paradice of his eyes, but at laſt ſhe proves a hell to his minde, obſerving himſelf to be equally happy in beholding her, and tormented by deſiring her. They legitimate their loves amongſt themſelves with promiſes of marriage: ſo that ſenſe being inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a bridle to reſtrain it, rais'd them in a ſhort time to a very high paſſion. <hi>Octavio</hi> frequented more then uſually a Chamber which over-look'd <hi>Florida</hi>'s Chamber, where he often waited as full of thoughts, as he was often full of grief; yet he never miſt an occaſion, ſeeing her appear on the Balcony, ſilently to ſignifie his affection to her, neither did ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear watchfully to receive it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but her diſcretion fain'd it una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48268:6"/>for that civility did not oblige her to ſhew her ſelf perverſe: a thouſand times was he about to ſpeak to her, but never durſt; poſſeſt with a youthful baſhfulneſs, at laſt after a great conteſt with himſelf he let fly a letter, the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ink hiding the bluſhes of his modeſty: The letter ſucceeded well, ſince <hi>Florida</hi> gladly received it, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly read it, and anſwered it (appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the window) with a kinde ſmile; 'twas a lamp which like St. <hi>Hermo</hi>'s fire cheer'd <hi>Octavio</hi>'s heart, which beat on the Sea of his affection, whence taking a good omen he began eaſily to hope for the calm of his contentment: being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with a devout acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he thanks his goddeſs who ſo kindly conſolated him, the neerneſs of the dwelling ſo fully favouring him, to make himſelf readily underſtood. She already caught with the good qualities of <hi>Octavis,</hi> perceiv'd her ſelf to be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, before ſhe knew ſhe was ſo cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lov'd, neither did ſhe want the will to make it appear, ſo that from their mutual correſpondence both their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions encreaſed unmeaſurably. The Lady gave way to the words of <hi>Octavio,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48268:6"/>ſhe (having put by all other reſpects) received them the more gratefully, the more endearing they were. They vow'd matrimony together with a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſent. <hi>Octavio</hi> thereby getting a glorious Alliance, and to <hi>Florida</hi> accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hopes of a great fortune. Beſides they both begg'd Heaven for a happy concluſion of their Nuptials. When <hi>Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardo</hi> (for ſo was <hi>Octavio's</hi> father call'd) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd his ſonnes flames, which as it's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for young men, were hotter then they were wary. He greatly diſdain'd it, not that ſhe diſpleas'd him for his daughter in law, but that he was afraid of her parents, who from her Cradle had deſign'd her for another. Yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeming to take notice of any of his ſonnes practices, that he might not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelfe to reſent it unto him, hee commands him to make ready to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe to terminate his commenc't ſtudies at <hi>Bollogna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Father hoping that <hi>Pallas</hi> being induſtrious, would there unlooſe that knot which had by <hi>Venus</hi> been knit in <hi>Parthenope.</hi> This paternall decree was a fatall blow to <hi>Octavio,</hi> who already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his departure as the paſſage from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48268:7"/>life to death: He afflicts himſelfe, ſighs, laments, curſeth his Fortune, his ſtudies, even his Fathers Genius, finds a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand excuſes to delay his journey, but they nothing prevailed ſince our Lover muſt obey. <hi>Florida</hi> remain'd aſtoniſhed at the newes of this ſad ſeparation, and then burſt forth into ſo high a reſentment of griefe which the tenderneſſe of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the folly of a lover could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuggeſt. She with a good will would have followed him, had ſhe not fear'd to have ruin'd him by the ruines of her ſelfe in repute and honour: Yet ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd like the Heliotrope, altogether mortified, when the Evening divorceth it from the Rayes of the Sunne. <hi>Octavio</hi> being gone, who went away immerc'd with griefe, bathing with his tears the earth he ſtampt on with his feet. Being arrived at <hi>Bologna,</hi> in the pleaſing quiet of Letters, he finds the warre of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſtill the more cruell; whence he concludes it falſe, That abſence cures the infirmity of love. His own thoughts became his executioners, alwayes marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing him with the memory of his ſo much regretted felicity, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more dear. The Lectures and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48268:7"/>Scholaſtick Conferences ſo gratefull to the vertuous, to him who was oppreſt with griefe, and whoſe ſoul was in an agony, ſeemed like Funerall Songs, and ſtudy appear'd truly the ſepulture of the living. He taſted not the Nectar of Wiſdome, ſince ſpirits weakned by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe, uſually ſuffer the diſreliſh of all good things. He then remained in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> and though in appearance he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Schooles, yet in effect he heard the Maſters as an Aſp, and profited like a ſtock: He liv'd a Scholar in name onely amongſt ſtudents without ſtudy, idle at their exerciſes, and ſo deſperate that he even loſt his life in that place where others render it immortall with the glory of Learning. <hi>Octavio</hi> was at laſt in the midſt of ſo many afflictions, conſolated by Fortune, who by the hands of certain Merchants cauſed his Fathers liberality to fall into his hands, converted into ſhowers of gold. So that being richly provided with money, he raviſheth himſelfe to <hi>Parthenope</hi> to viſit his <hi>Florida,</hi> the ſweet cauſe of his cruell torments. Being arrived unknown without going to his Father, he ſo orders the buſineſſe, that ſhe hath notice of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48268:8"/>arrivall, ſo that through the favourable darkneſſe of the night, he came to adore her at a little window of her houſe. It's ſuperfluous to relate the Complements which paſt, or how many tears were ſhed out of tenderneſs, ſince any man knows what affections an unthought-of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will raiſe in two hearts tenderly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one the other, and ſo long tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ſuch longing deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view one another. But theſe pleaſures laſted but a few nights, for that <hi>Octavio</hi> refus'd treacherouſly to tempt his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, having already experimented, that with velocity ſhe turns her wheele in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, but ſlowly in time of miſery. He therefore parts burthening himſelfe by this his new departure with new griefs, and being ſcarce come to <hi>Bologna,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hardly furniſhed himſelfe with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, that the buſineſſe might not be diſcovered, he retakes his journey back again to <hi>Parthenope.</hi> So that for the ſpace of a whole year he alternatively travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and reſting, liv'd betwixt torments and contentments. The yeare being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at an end, <hi>Octavio</hi> being at <hi>Bologna,</hi> falls fick of a Feaver; which though it was without danger, yet was long, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48268:8"/>many great perplexities of mind befell him, becauſe it diverted him from his journey. In the mean time <hi>Horatio</hi> (for ſo was <hi>Florida's</hi> father call'd) concludes her marriage with <hi>Don Fernando</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Tuedos,</hi> ſhe having been from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy deſign'd for him: He was of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> deſcended from Dukes, a Cavalier of a ſmall Fortune, of great parentage, and for pretences at all. He preſumed that he had a greater wealth then truly he poſſeſt, that he was more valiant then indeed he was, and yet more Gentile then he ſeem'd; of a ſhort ſtature, of a proud port, of a brown complexion, and lame; ſo that to give the faire <hi>Florida</hi> to <hi>Fernando,</hi> was the ſame thing as afreſh to grant a <hi>Venus</hi> to a <hi>Vulcan.</hi> This was the Bridegroom which <hi>Horatio</hi> had prepar'd not to accommodate his daughter, but to advantage himſelfe in the Court of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Curſed intereſt! cruel and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <hi>Numens!</hi> which neceſſitates men to ſacrifice even their own children unto you. <hi>Florida</hi> having heard the concluſion of the marriage, became ſad, yet ſeem'd pleas'd to her Father, and diſpenc'd tears, which ſeem'd of joy, but were of grief. After a day ſhe feigns herſelf ill, and begs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48268:9"/>that all publick or privat ſolemnity might be ſuſpended till her recovery. In the mean time ſhe diſpatcheth a Letter to <hi>Octavio,</hi> which included this following ſenſe.</p>

            <p>THis Letter was an enchantment which would have raviſhed <hi>Octavio</hi> out of Hell aſwel as from his bed. He who already was better'd in his health roſe aſſoon as he had read it, and no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner got to horſe, but away for <hi>Parthenope,</hi> guided by fury and accompanied with diſpair. Somtimes with a raging heart he wiſh'd himſelf alive only to be reveng'd of his Rival, and ſomtimes with a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate voice he begg'd Heaven to thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrike him, that he might not ſee <hi>Florida</hi> either ſubject to death, or <hi>Fernando</hi>'s Spouſe. But Fortune, which equally preſerves both fools and deſperate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, happily brings this unhappy man to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48268:10"/>
               <hi>Parthenope;</hi> being arrived at his Father <hi>Odoardo</hi>'s houſe; and before he lighted from his horſe having ſeen the fair <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> appear at the Balcony, he ſalutes her with a joy mixt with grief of heart, as ignorant whether he honoured her as his own, or as the ſpouſe of another man. Fortune would have it ſo, he findes his Father's houſe without his Father, who was newly parted for ſome Domeſtick occaſion, whereby he had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſpeak from his wonted apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his deareſt, who thereby teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied inexplicable ſignes of contentment. The firſt complement paſt, ſhe confirms him the great danger of her life, how far greater her faith was, and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him her affection was ſupreme: She alſo added, my <hi>Octavio</hi> did you know with how much ſatisfaction for your ſake I ſhall encounter death, perhaps without ſwearing you will beleeve me, that I pretend not thereby the leaſt jot of merit towards you. So that if your civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in its own reſpect, affords me any power over you, I will not that it ſhould extend it ſelf farther then to beg of you that you ſhould never ſuffer grief to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict you, for whatever fatal accidents
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48268:10"/>happen to me: Foraſmuch as if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the actions of the living is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the dead, beleeve me, that your torments will for ever be my hell. <hi>Octavio</hi> was violenc'd with ſo ſenſible an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but profering an anſwer, he was hindred by his Fathers arrival. So that he parted readily to meet him: <hi>Odoardo</hi> tenderly imbrac'd his ſon, which being with exceſs it ſhall ſuffice to ſpeak, it was fatherly: He doubly rejoyced to ſee his ſon recovered of his feaver, and beleeving him wholy cured of his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſions, he eſteem'd himſelf the happieſt that liv'd. Unſatisfied with kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, and asking him of his health and journey, related him the newes of the Citie, amongſt which he told him he was in good time come to enjoy the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals which were preparing for the marriage of <hi>Florida.</hi> Truly, Sir, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Octavio,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Horatio</hi> you perhaps may ſooner ſee a Funerall then a Bridall; and thereupon diſcovered the whole ſucceſſe of his love, <hi>Florida's</hi> reſolution, with his own intention to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her, to the venture of his life and honor. The Father was aſtoniſhed at ſo ſtrange a relation, and bold a propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48268:11"/>being afterwards quite enraged, he went about beating the ground with his feet, and wringing his hands. Patience (exclaimes he) O Fortune! I my ſelfe in begetting a ſonne have provided my ſelf an inſtrument of mortification to afflict me. Which having ſaid, he retires him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into another Chamber, leaving <hi>Octavio</hi> alone in great confuſion. If <hi>Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardo's</hi> diſtemper were great, the fury of <hi>Horatio</hi> that very night was farre greater, foraſmuch as <hi>Florida</hi> having been as much inſpired by the preſence of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> as ſhe had been diſheartned by his abſence, boldly confeſt her amorous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes. But what above meaſure inrag'd his paternall mind, was her ſixt reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never to have <hi>Fernando</hi> for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. <hi>Horatio</hi> at that inſtant would have run her through, had he not thought to have pleas'd her, when ſhe with artificiall tears beg'd of him, rather to give her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Death, then into the Spaniards. He afterwards rail'd on her with a thouſand injuries, and threatned to correct her as a Girle; but the remedy appeared too vulgar for ſo deſperate a caſe, ſo that he the more laboured with diſdain, by reaſon he found no meanes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48268:11"/>to qualifie it. He conſum'd all the night in ſtudying vengeance, which is the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate child of fury, and the illegitimate ſatisfaction of a generous ſpirit. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day which ſucceeded this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled night, hee impriſons <hi>Florida</hi> in a Cloyſter, yet in the ſame where was her ſiſter <hi>Bellaria,</hi> who was in time to be made a Nun, and be obedient to that vocation which her Fathers avarice and cruelty had inſpir'd. <hi>Octavio</hi> having heard the newes of her impriſonment, hee could neither retain his teares, nor remit his griefe: The counſell of his friends, nor the prayers of his parents, were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conſolate him, ſo that his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Father confidently beleeved that his ſonnes health would ſhipwrack on the rock of deſpaire, yet did he not forbeare to perſwade him to deſiſt from that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with well-ſeaſon'd admonitions of wiſdome; but he well perceiv'd he had ſown ſalt, ſince he reaped no fruit. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> on the other ſide rampant with rage, ſwore to bee reveng'd of <hi>Octavio,</hi> threatens murthers, marſhalls defies, and chalenges Duels; but in ſuch a manner, that that fury which ought to appear in action, vaniſhed in words, imitating
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48268:12"/>Heaven, which the more it thunders, it intends the leſſe to lighten. <hi>Horatio</hi> who had truly bound the hopes of his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages with the bond of this Marriage, ſeeing them fled away to his loſſe, in tends his revenge, providing a bravo ſnare to murther <hi>Octavio.</hi> But wiſer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice reſtrain'd him, perſwading him to make uſe of diſſimulation, which is the ordinary net wherein without noyſe we may enſnare our enemies. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feign'd it fit for him to change aire, by reaſon of an accuſtomed indiſpoſition which befell him, he parts from <hi>Partheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye,</hi> having for a while ſuſpended his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. In the mean time <hi>Odoardo,</hi> that he might not loſe his ſonne, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fallen into a high fit of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reſolved to loſe himſelfe with him, promiſing all his endeavours for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his deſires. With theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Octavio</hi> reſpires again from his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and having already provided him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of armed men to attend him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to walk about the City, Fortune leads him to the encounter of <hi>Fernando,</hi> who at that time ſtir'd not at all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was that the poore Cavalier had forgot the oaths he had ſworn, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48268:12"/>or that hee remembred that Oaths of doing ill are not obligatory. <hi>Octavio</hi> thus ſeeing himſelf victorious without Fighting, puts by all ſuſpition, and begins to frequent the Monaſtery of <hi>Florida,</hi> uſing a faign'd Devotion, as if his Object were Idolatry, not Adoration. There he daily entertain'd himſelf to ſee the fair Priſoner, but ſhee appear'd not, being guarded by her Superiours; ſo that the miſerable man would willingly have chang'd his Nature with that of the <hi>Lynx,</hi> ſo as hee might have gotten Eyes whoſe looks would pierce the walls which hid his Faireſt from Him. At laſt having tempted much, and deſired more that he might but be introduc'd to ſpeak with <hi>Bellaria,</hi> who being as 'twas thought within a while to bee a Nun, had liberty to appear at the Grate to take her leave of the World: <hi>Octavio</hi> relates the ſeries of his Love, and with ſo much paſſion exagerates his Affections, that the Maid was forced to ſhew her ſelf pitifull, leaſt ſhe ſhould diſcover Her ſelf inhumane. Shee was of ſuch corrected Manners, that ſhe rather would have choſen death, than to engage Her ſelf in an action any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48268:13"/>wayes diſhoneſt. Yet ſhee thought that to ſerve <hi>Octavio</hi> in his Love, was the ſame thing as to ſerve Juſtice it ſelf; ſince <hi>Florida</hi> appear'd due to Him who had purchas'd her with ſo many Pearles of his Tears and Sweat. So that ſhee modeſtly offers it; proteſting. That it was as deteſtable for her to have <hi>Fernando</hi> for her brother-in-Law, as hee was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by <hi>Florida</hi> for a Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavio</hi> thanks her, darting forth by a treacherous Joy a moſt affectionate ſenſe of the obligation, but confus'd He then begs her to kiſs for him his <hi>Florida</hi>'s Hand; which being readily executed by Her, gave our Lover meanes afterward to truſt her with his Letters, Ambaſſies, and Preſents to her Siſter.</p>
            <p>The curious Inquiſitiors of <hi>Parthenope,</hi> diſcours'd the reaſons of <hi>Florida</hi>'s Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, to the wonder of all, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of thoſe, who (alwayes making an ill interpretation of other Mens actions) uſe the leaſt occaſion they can to give cauſe of ſpeaking ill, and to divulge Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. But the common Friends of HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATIO and OCTAVIO, perceiving that there was a fire kindling betwixt the two Families, which without blood
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48268:13"/>could not bee quench'd, thought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it at its birth. Whereupon they wrote to <hi>Horatio,</hi> obliging him to return far ſooner then he intended; and being come, they calmly treated a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Horatio</hi> although He were very perverſe was at laſt content. So as <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi> would renounce <hi>Florida</hi> to <hi>Fernando,</hi> &amp; in her ſtead take <hi>Bellaria</hi> to Wife. The Party was propos'd to <hi>Octavio,</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering nothing, ſeem'd well ſatisfy'd, as the onely way whereby hee hoped to releaſe his Lady out of her Priſon. The peace was thus concluded, and the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings appointed by the falſe promiſes of the Lover, who deferr'd not to come according to his Cuſtom to the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to acquaint <hi>Florida</hi> with his incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Faith; delivers a Letter to <hi>Bellaria;</hi> ſhee, who was already advis'd of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes upon the Treaty of Peace, believ'd her ſelf to be his Spouſe, denies the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, deſiring him to excuſe her, for ſhee reſolved to ſerve him hereafter no longer then under the notion of his Wiſe. <hi>Octavio</hi> ſigh'd, and eſteem'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unhappy at the newes, but laments <hi>Florida</hi> as more unfortunate, beleeving her ſelf betray'd, and ſuppoſing her ſelf
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48268:14"/>ſcorn'd by an Idolatrous Lover. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee deſpair'd as one without a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, foraſmuch as 'twas impoſſible for him to ſpeak with his cruell Dear, and to write to her was denyed him by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laria,</hi> who was already become her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, diffident and jealous of her.</p>
            <p>Being thus at a loſſe, ſhe went about the Cloyſters, bewayling her deſperate hopes, and curſing her owne Fortune which had induc'd her to preſerve her Life for ſo ungratefull a Perſon, and ſo long to loſe her Liberty: But above all, the memory of her <hi>Octavio</hi> moſt of all tormented her; Dear, although ſhe even eſteem'd him a Traytor. <hi>Fernando</hi> was then at Rome, when the reconcilement was made, which nevertheleſs was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his conſent: So that when all men expected the ſolemnizing of the Weddings, <hi>Octavio</hi> freely frequented <hi>Bellaria</hi> with his Viſits, ſtill importuning her with intreaties to induce her to favor him as ſhe had formerly towards <hi>Florida.</hi> Nevertheleſs <hi>Bellaria</hi> reſiſted the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for as much as her intereſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her conſtant, although even ſhee was a Woman. But at laſt, when ſhee ſaw ſhee could not with hers, reſiſt the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48268:14"/>others perſeverance, ſhe chang'd her reſolution; whence being become kind, ſhe afreſh carries his ſalutes to her ſiſter, embaſſies and letters: the lover ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpired in this calm of fortune, which laſted no longer then the coming of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> to <hi>Parthenope;</hi> who being come, <hi>Bellaria</hi> in all haſt ſends for <hi>Octavio,</hi> and tells him; that <hi>Florida</hi> in deſpite of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, being reſolved to have him onely for her husband, pray'd him to expect her that night neer the gate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for that ſhe reſolved that very night to fly away with him. The glad Lover, as any man may imagine, as he who had long expected happily to reap the fruits of his pains, parted, having truſted his deſign to a confident ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his, with whom that night he comes to his determin'd poſt.</p>
            <p>It happened that <hi>Fernando</hi> that very day arrived in Town (the ſame which <hi>Bellaria</hi> had appointed) who had not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited his ſpouſe, being hindred by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick affairs, and diverted by a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who forcibly led him away with him to dinner, and detain'd him even the ſupper; it being then late, and having taken leave of his kinſman; ſo that to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48268:15"/>guard himſelf from the ſiniſter encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the night, for his own ſecurity he had with him a train of armed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: His way neceſſarily was by this Convent, ſo that ſeeing <hi>Octavio</hi> ſtand immoveable neer the gate, he knew him, but was undiſcovered by him: and then imgining that he ſtayed there for ſome amorous booty; he curious to know the truth, to that end watcheth behind the corner of the wall: He had not long with great ſilence expected, when he hears the door open'd, and advancing a ſtep or two he ſees <hi>Octavio,</hi> who was coming away with the Lady; when with a raging fury having unſheath'd his ſword, he aſſails him treacherouſly, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues him, ſo that the miſerable man was forc'd to forſake his prey, that he might not loſe his life. <hi>Fernando</hi> being very well pleaſed with the victory, follows his way being highly oblig'd by fortune who had brought him ſo happily to be reveng'd of his rival, by raviſhing his pretended ſpouſe, even out of his arms. But being come home, holding the Lady by the hand, who ſad and penſive went along with him, he ſaw by the light of a torch, that he handed a deceit, foraſmuch
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48268:15"/>as it was <hi>Bellaria</hi> and not <hi>Florida</hi> which ne had gotten. He was aſtoniſh'd! Chang'd countenance! And with diſdain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving demanded the reaſon of her which oblig'd her to fly; She anſwered, That finding her ſelf deſpis'd by <hi>Octavio,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the obligation of his promiſe, ſhe had endevor'd to gain by deceit what was denied her by his rigid obſtinacy; whereupon ſhe faign'd her ſelf the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Florida,</hi> and ſo was flying away with him. <hi>Fernando</hi> then anſwers, <hi>Madam,</hi> Revenge your ſelf once more of your deſpiſer by deſpiſing him; and ſince Fortune hath given you, as a prey, into my hands, do you make a prey of me, binding me with the bonds of marriage and matrimonial faith: <hi>Bellaria</hi> thank'd him, and (being uncertain of <hi>Octavio</hi>'s life, and fearful to remain without a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) ſhe ſoon grants his offer, and the ſame night concludes the wedding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without her Fathers conſent. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavio</hi> on the other ſide being ful of gref, and the fright being over, he finds his body without wounds, but his mind was doubly transfixd with jealouſie &amp; ſhame. What furies that night tormented him,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48268:16"/>his reſolution may witneſs, which was to fly from <hi>Parthenope,</hi> that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that heaven no more which had been ſo cruel to him in his loves: <hi>Florida,</hi> even ſhe alſo having underſtood of her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters departure, was already grown wild, holding it for undoubted that ſhe was fled with her diſloyal <hi>Octavio;</hi> So that abominating the fallacies and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this world, ſhe reſolved with her ſelf to abandon it, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Nun, and willingly would that very night have cut off her hair, but that the action required a publick ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; but the ſucceeding day bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thoſe ſhadows, from both Lovers, ſtopt their grief, and bridled their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; the fame of the deceit being ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd about the City, and withal of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando's</hi> Nuptials: <hi>Horatio</hi> to whom it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually imported to gain <hi>Fernando</hi> for his ſon in law, aſwel by <hi>Bellaria</hi>'s as <hi>Florida</hi>'s means, was nothing mov'd at that nights accident: but accommodating himſelf to the neceſſity, granted <hi>Octavio</hi> his long lamented, and dearly beloved <hi>Florida;</hi> ſo that both Marriages were joyfully Solemnized. And Fate witneſſed in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48268:16"/>the perſon of <hi>Octavio,</hi> that by unknown wayes ſhe directs Men to the acqueſt of thoſe felicities, whereto they could never aim by the Conduct of humane prudence.</p>

The more he was deſpis'd, the more he lov'd; He let ſlip no occaſion to diſcover his wound; He being continually in her ſight, aſſaulted her with ſighs, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged pitty from her with his looks.</p>

            <p>The letter being ſealed, he ſighs for the means how it might be ſecurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Aleria</hi>'s hands. The ſervants
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48268:19"/>although they were all gain'd by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his liberalty durſt not aſſault their Ladies affections, ſo much the chaſter, for as yet ſhe gave no leave to be tempted. To uſe other perſons, might prove both ſcandalous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo that he reſolves to be himſelf the bearer: Having fitted a day when ſhe was at Church, perhaps more pray'd to then praying; getting neer her, cheating the ſuſpition and obſervation of many, he puts his note in <hi>Aleria</hi>'s Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, when ſhe caſually had laid them behind her, to intend her mental private prayers. No body was ware of it. <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> her ſelf, although ſhe took up her Offices, did not preſently perceive it. Scarce did ſhe finde it, but ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently overtaken with bluſhing, more diſdain'd againſt her ſelf, that ſhe had given the boldneſs to any man to tempt her, then that ſhe was diſpleaſed at the temptation. The prudence of this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knew well that ſhe did not deſerve the name of chaſt, who did not reſiſt the flatteries of Lovers; whoever is chaſt out of neceſſity is unworthy the title. <hi>Aleria</hi> having quieted her mind from the firſt confuſions, which had ſtoln
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48268:20"/>the blood from her heart, and had left the Characters on her face: when ſhe thought it fit overcoming her curioſity, which is natural to women, ſhe tears the letter in a thouſand pieces, as if that had been guilty of the fault, which his auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city deſerv'd who had given it her. <hi>Ar. derico</hi> felt his own heart torn in pieces, with the tearing of the letter, deſpairing ever after of any invention, whereby he might make known his affection. He was loſt in a confuſion at her behaviour, who being ador'd, not onely took it ungratefully, but ſeem'd as if ſhe would not know her adorer; yet the miſerable man continues his ſervitude ſo much the more unhappy, as his hopes were far from their reward. It ſo happen'd that <hi>Aleria</hi> accompanied with her husband retires to a <hi>Villa</hi> to enjoy that ſeaſon, which bearing more fruit then the reſt, flatters with the more pleaſure the guſt of men: <hi>Arderico</hi> who was this Suns Heliotrope, follows her, not without hope that the pleaſures of the <hi>Villa</hi> might bring him to what he was debarr'd off by the divertiſement of the Town; he thought more eaſily to corrupt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Villa;</hi> the minds of men being
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48268:20"/>the more vile, the more they are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted. He was ſeen to come thither, but he begins to go the round about <hi>Aleria</hi>'s houſe, faigning to plant nets to catch birds, and to hunt wild beaſts; Whilſt his heart was in the nets of love, and continually diſturbed with the ſenſe of his own paſſions. One day being carryed either by chance or choice, he enters her Palace, pretending the recovery of a Hawke which he had lately ſet off his fiſt. The Count of <hi>Sancta Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce, Aleria</hi>'s husband, receives him with all kinde of civility uſual amongſt Cavaliers; after having commanded his ſervants to look after the flight of the Hawke, he leads <hi>Arderico</hi> to his wife; I can ſay nothing of this incounter, but I remit it to your imagination; its ſufficient that <hi>Arderico</hi> bluſht, grew pale again, ſweat, and freez'd at the ſame time: He with a curteous violence was conſtrain'd to eat ſome fruit; but whilſt his eyes fed on thoſe beloved beauties, all other food was noiſom. At laſt having recover'd his Hawke, after ſome Complements he parts with a greater paſſion then he brought: He never ſaw <hi>Aleria</hi>'s looks ſo favourable, neither had he ſo expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48268:21"/>her ſo officious as then: <hi>Aleria</hi> being pleas'd with the faſhion of <hi>Arderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> demands of her husband the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's name, who had deſerv'd from him ſuch a friendly treat. The Count ſmil'd at the propoſition, and ſays, What do you not know <hi>Arderico,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Caſtel-Novo?</hi> Is it poſſible you ſhould be ſo blinde to the ſplendors of the Sun; Pardon me, if you trouble me not, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by a ſubject ſo worthy to be known; one muſt neceſſarily judge, that your heart is hard, or your minde deviated, ſince you want eies to know the deſerts of ſuch a Cavalier. Perfection, which in all other things regrets its wants, in this Lord all wiſhes are at full. Who with an unerring prudence cauſeth thoſe to love, who even ſhould hate him with a diſintereſted ſtrength, never arms himſelf but in favour of what is juſt, with a moderation of practiſe he hath overcome envy: In fine he hath no equal in armes, no ſuperior in letters, and in Nobility is without a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; he enjoyes all priviledges of the Mind and of Fortune; there is no Lady in <hi>Vicenza,</hi> who would not beleeve her beauty fortunate, were ſhe honor'd but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48268:21"/>with a look from that noble Cavalier; do not ſhew your ſelf ſo careleſs in knowing the prerogatives of others, if you will have me have worthy thoughts of you. <hi>Aleria</hi> coldly excuſeth her ſelf, repenting in her own heart, that ſhe had ſo long paſt by the ſervice of a man, who for his ſingular conditions deſerv'd the affections of all: Being thus fill'd with his praiſe, ſhe grows ſo fervently in love with <hi>Arderico,</hi> that ſhe quite rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the laws of honeſty. That hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty which could not be overcome by a continued obſequiouſneſs, which aw'd the perſwaſions of her ſervants, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn'd the treacheries of her lover, the combats of ſenſe, and the power of love, now poſtitutes it ſelf to ordinary words, betray'd by his tongue who ſhould have guarded it: That heart which could not be fully vanquiſh'd by the eyes, findes it ſelf betray'd by the ears: Carried thus away with the furies which agitate the minde of one in love. The Count being call'd to <hi>Vicenza</hi> by the neceſſity of ſome affairs, ſhe ſignes a paper with theſe Characters.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48268:24"/>envy in all the women that beheld her. The contentment Lovers received to ſee thoſe admirable graces in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they paid withuſury, by the loſs of their liberty. In fine, this Sun blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hearts, no leſs then eyes, and he was rather eſteem'd ſtupid then pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent who could eſcape ſo ſweet a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and he was call'd ſacrilegious, who ſacrificed not his heart to the Idol of her Beauty. This treaſury of Natures richneſs was poſſeſt by way of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by the Count of <hi>Caſtel-Novo,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier indued with all the favours which Fortune could diſpence, or Vertue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But he was thought not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by the Counteſs, becauſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was abroad in Princes Courts, or in the wars, excerciſing himſelf in arms more then in love: Which was eaſily beleev'd by the deſires of many, who thought to ſubdue that Fort, which was onely guarded with beauty, which was eaſily to be corrupted with preſents, or overcome by the violence of ſervices and entreaties, but they ſoon found themſelves deceiv'd, finding ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from the vertue and ſhamefac'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lady, that ſome were forc'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48268:25"/>quite to abandon the undertaking; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to raiſe the ſiege, and others to expect occaſion, which is the daughter of time; onely the Marqueſs <hi>Oliverio,</hi> the firſt amongſt the proudeſt, both for Wealth and Nobility, abated nothing of his reſolutions. But followed the aſſault with ſo much the greater ardor, by how much the more deſperate he thought the Victory: He had overcome denials, repulſes, and diſdains, which inſteed to exſtinguiſh, made the fire of his heart ſtill the greater: And although he hop'd for no further advance in conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the pudicity of that Lady, yet did he omit no means poſſible, which might make him deſerve the title of a true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſince he could not prevail to be lov'd again; and ſo much the more, for that with gifts he had poſſeſt himſelf of the good will of all thoſe who ſerv'd her, ſo that the poor Ladies ears were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually befieg'd with this Cavaliers prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the whole Family being never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of celebrating his valor; ſometimes his birth, his bounty, his wealth, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his magnaminity. And although theſe commendations being often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, mov'd her to admire ſuch rare qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48268:25"/>yet this oblig'd her to no other love, but that which vertue begets in a noble breaſt: But what <hi>Oliverio</hi> could not achieve with all his love, treacheries; he ſtill did beleeve that in proceſs of time a moment of Fortune would gain. The Counteſs had a young brother, and rich, which is ſufficient to ſpeak him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent; There was no ſcandalous buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the City wherein he ſhar'd not, or was not principal; night which brings reſt and quiet even to the inſatiable fury of wild beaſts diſquieted him, then he uſually went about the City offending equally all he met: but ill actions brings at laſt to a juſt puniſhment; when one night he would by force have enter'd the houſe of a Lady of honor, and already began to uſe violence on the doors and windows; whereupon being taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, by four Companions he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time nor boldneſs enough to reſiſt; the threats wherewith he had alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd the Lady having alſo rais'd the neighbourhood againſt him. His impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment was no ſooner known, but bills were ſo multiplied againſt him, that his life was even call'd in queſtion. The Counteſs who lov'd him as being her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48268:26"/>brother, and could not endure to ſee him ſuffer a publick puniſhment, having no mony in a readineſs, quickly procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from certain Merchants 1000. piſtols, giving them the beſt part of her jewels in pawn; with this money ſhe ſo deals with the Lord Governor, whoſe eyes being blinded with the ſplendor of the Gold, look'd juſtice like. The young man with his Companions eſcapes by the conivence of the Commander, who fearing leaſt his avarice ſhould be diſcover'd, would have the guilty fly far away, to eſtrange thoſe teſtimonies which might convince the Judge of guilt. The Counteſs enjoy'd not much by her brothers deliverance, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a letter from her husband which reduc'd her to diſpair; the Count com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her that without delay ſhe ſhould with all her coſtlieſt apparel come to <hi>Millan,</hi> to wait on the Imperatrix, who was hourly expected to paſs there. The poor Lady being agitated with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoughts, knew not what reſolution to take, which might neither be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, nor dangerous. To go to <hi>Millan</hi> without her Jewels which are ſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48268:26"/>requiſite in ſuch occaſions, it would very much have prejudic'd the reputation of her greatneſs: To diſcover the freeing of her brother ſhe could not without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring her husbands anger, there being betwixt them particular diguſts. After many things which floated about in her minde, ſhe forceth her heart to the law of neceſſity; and taking her pen, ſhe writes theſe Carracters.</p>

            <p>Without delay he cauſed the Letter with the Mony to be delivered into the hands of the Counteſs; who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her Jewels preſently goes for <hi>Millan;</hi> arriving juſt at the Emperatrix's coming, ſhe made ſo pompous a ſhew of her own beauty, that the Emperatrice thought her much ſelf honor'd by thoſe people who had ſent a Sun to meet her: The envy of the Ladies was chang'd into admiration, and it ſeem'd as if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had robb'd beauty from all other perſons prodigally to beſtow it onely on her. The Emperatrice parts from <hi>Millan,</hi> having preſented her with a very fair Neck-lace, and ſhe preſently returns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where <hi>Oliverio</hi> expected her with thoſe impatiences, which are furies which continually agitate the Minde of Lovers. The Marqueſs would not appear in <hi>Millan</hi> at this occaſion; that he might cauſe no ſuſpition to the obſervation of ſo many eyes, or to ſhun
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48268:28"/>the obligation of ſerving the Empera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice. He no ſooner knew of her return, but he ſent to congratulate her arrival, and to beg her favour. She gave him to underſtand, that that very evening after midnight ſhe would be at a grate, which look'd on a little unfrequented ſtreet; <hi>Oliverio</hi> obeys, and at the hour appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hears himſelf call'd by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs: At this firſt meeting I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the paſſions of <hi>Oliverio;</hi> he ſweat and freez'd in an inſtant; he in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner confounded, praiſes with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings with ſo much change, that he was hardly to be underſtood. The Counteſs correſponded to all with ſuch affectionate and diſcreet language, that at the ſame time ſhe no leſs witneſſed her diſcretion then her affection. All their thanks terminated in this Concluſion, that the next night he ſhould enter by the Garden Gate, with an expreſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſhould be brought in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light: whereto the Marqueſs pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily return'd, that there needed no light where his Sun did ſhine: Being gone, he ſpent the reſt of the night with a thouſand amorous paſſions; he no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſees the ſpringing of the day, but he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48268:29"/>deſires the night; he a thouſand times accuſeth the Sun of ſlowneſs, for that it accelerated not its courſe according to his wiſhes: He even blam'd the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, diſputing command, that they were ſo long before they occupy'd the dominion of the Air. At laſt the long ſigh'd for hour came, when he ſoftly comes to the Garden; finding the door open, he goes directly to the Counteſſes lodgings. She who expected him, taking him by the hand, tells him; Friend, if you love my reputation and my life, it will become you to ſacrifice this night to ſilence: My women are ſo neer my Chamber, that the leaſt word would cauſe a high ſuſpition; neither is my love ſo unworthy, that I dare truſt it to a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile maid; and the rather, becauſe the greater enjoyments admit of no words; ſhe permitted him no anſwer, but led him into a Chamber, and then having told him he might pull off his clothes and go to bed, whilſt ſhe would ſee whether her women ſlept. He was no ſooner diſpoyl'd of his clothes, but he findes himſelf in the armes of a beauty, ſo much the more ſingular, as ſhe was the leſs ſubject to the cenſure of the eyes. My
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48268:29"/>pen dares not deſcribe what they did, leaſt it ſhould profane the ſecrets of the night; Its ſufficient to ſay, that he being raviſh'd with the ſweetneſs of thoſe embraces, bleſt all the labours, all the ſights, and all the torments which he had till then ſuffer'd; ſince his paſt pains ſerv'd for no other uſe, but to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his preſent contentment. Fearful leaſt the light ſhould diſcover their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous theft: <hi>Oliverio</hi> departs before the comming of Aurora; and being forbid to uſe words, he takes his leave with a multitude of kiſſes. Being retired to his own habitation, with reſt and ſleep he procures the releaſe of his paſt labours, which yet had ſucceeded ſo ſweetly, that he thought onely how he might repeat them. Being riſen about dinner time, one of his ſervants brings him a thouſand Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols with a letter, which having open'd with a ſtrange trouble, he ſees theſe words.</p>

            <p>Having ſent the letter, and with a thouſand imprecations having expected the night, he comes to the appointed place, where having found the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs; after ſalutations paſt, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs hegins to reprove her for ſending the money; which he did with ſuch a lively ſenſe, that tears interrupted him, which permitted him not to evaporate his grief by his mouth &amp; eyes. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs anſwers with a ſweet ſmile; And why would you not hav me reſtore what was yours? Becauſe ſaies <hi>Oliverio,</hi> after I had received the honor of your good graces; I have nothing which is not abſolutely yours: Pray therefore bitter not our paſt ſweets. And pray what ſweets were thoſe, replies the Counteſs? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſays <hi>Oliverio,</hi> that the interpoſition of a day onely ſhould have ſo eclips'd your memory, that you have forgotten thoſe delights which were both given and receiv'd. Is it poſſible that thoſe kiſſes which were altogether anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted carrying continually love on the lips, ſhould inſtil the water of <hi>Lethe</hi> in your heart; I ſhould ſooner loſe the remembrance of my ſelf, then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light I have from the memory of ſuch
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48268:31"/>ſweets as thoſe. The Counteſs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him, telling him, My Lord, I ſhall undeceive you, it being unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that your opinion ſhould ſtain my honeſty, which is hitherto no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies guilty, but by what it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from your deſires or belief. I thought to pleaſe you with a deceit, in ſome manner to correſpond with my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and your love. The love practiſes of the other night were with my Chamber-maid <hi>Aleria,</hi> I being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid both by the advantage of my birth, and my husbands honor: She is here preſent to give teſtimony of this truth. <hi>Oliverio</hi> expected not that ſhe ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in her diſcourſe; but full of malice, returned home machinating in his minde, a thouſand precipices againſt the reputation and life of the Counteſs. At laſt reaſon having gain'd the field, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prudence of the Lady, who without prejudice of her own honor had ſo prettily deceiv'd her lover; he chang'd his ſenſuality into friendſhip and reſpect.

            <p>NAPLES is a City delightful in all ſeaſons; the flattring accents of the inhabiting <hi>Sirens</hi> turns with the reeling lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Fortune: if the truth prevail, their mindes are to be preferr'd to all others, like thoſe of Paradice. Many years ſince in that place, as in a Theater
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48268:33"/>amongſt others, the chance of two moſt noble Cavaliers was preſented; who qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with that air, fruitful in titles, were call'd moſt excellent Princes: The one <hi>Gernando,</hi> the other <hi>Anſelmo;</hi> the vicinity of their Palaces, the likeneſs of their years, the ſympathy of their mindes had in a manner ſo united their wills, that having inſeparably ingrafted their hearts, they poſſeſt nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them imcommunicable, but their wives. <hi>Gernando</hi> was married with the Princeſs <hi>Leonora,</hi> who mixing in her moſt beautiful countenance, ſweetneſs withſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity &amp; majeſty, repreſented only a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſmutation taken from the moſt exquiſit excellencies of <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Bellona. Anſelmo</hi> was wedded to <hi>Celinda,</hi> a Lady, who with her ſweet behaviour, and with her winning faſhion, was thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be preferr'd to the Graces, to ſuckle and nouriſh moſt tender loves; Both the one and the other liv'd a whole age deliciating themſelves with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate ſweets of exquiſit pleaſures; their world would have been beleev'd a Heaven, had their happineſs but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wheel'd about; they often left the City to diſport themſelves
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48268:33"/>amongſt the delightful Groves of their pleaſant Villa's, where fully enjoying the prerogatives of a Golden age, each did enjoy in their own amorous poſſeſſions the redoubled content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the others legitimate enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; jealouſie did not ſowre their ſweet, the leaſt cloud of grief did not diſturb the tranquillity of their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; They uſually went out to enjoy the freſh air of the cleer morning, and what beyond meaſure was <hi>Leonora</hi>'s ſport, which had a bizar capricio to ſhoot birds, incredibly bragging at every ſhot ſhe made, of her prey, whilſt <hi>Celinda</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended more tender paſtimes, gathering the Flowers of the field; ſhe weav'd Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands to crown the triumphs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering companion; neither did they with leſs pleaſure paſs the remainder of the day, for <hi>Roſalba Celinda</hi>'s Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman did harmoniouſly ſing, whilſt <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48268:34"/>beauties. Amongſt the reſt, one day <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalba</hi> having let looſe her voice to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of a wanton ſong, ſhe lighted on ſuch affectionate notes, upon the laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs of ſome amorous accident, that ſhe awaken'd the ſoul of <hi>Gernando</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire her good grace and facility, he began like thoſe who dote, accuſing himſelf of ſacriledge, for that till then he had not contemplated in that moſt beautiful ſinger, the excellency of the nobleſt Seraphin in Heaven; whereupon his heart being incourag'd by the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration of murthering accents, he the more lively imprinted that likeneſs, which condemned him to the ſufferance of ſuch a grievous martyrdom: where the wretch at once being bloodleſs and liveleſs, his motion and ſpeech being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, he lifts up a languiſhing look with a dying ſigh, you would ſwear that he retain'd not the leaſt ſpirit of life; the Laſs obſerv'd it, and joggs <hi>Dorilla,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that her finging had wounded his minde, and colouring her cheeks, with roſy bluſhes, with which ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft the miſerable dying man, of accuſing the murtherous wound, yet ſhe thereby forbore not the more ſpitefully to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48268:34"/>it; ſo that with the tone of her voice lifting up the lamp of a ſmile, ſhe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo ſweet a look, that faſcinating him with a wonderful Magick, ſhe took him quite away from living any longer to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora,</hi> and brought him to live a freſh, but a painful life in her own boſom; from that time the unhapy man felt ſo unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable a fire to run about his heart, which inwardly burning him, ſends up the aſhes into his face to accuſe the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as inextinguiſhable: Thus did this miſerable man burn, and ſilence it three whole moneths. Being brought to Town he was viſited by the Phiſitians, and afterwards forſaken; whoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, that he was oppreſt with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known diſeaſe, and that his ill was incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; <hi>Leonora</hi> aflicted her ſelf at the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her beloved conſort, and no leſs, amongſt themſelves ſuffering the like, did <hi>Anſelmo</hi> and <hi>Celinda</hi> lament; ſo that daily frequenting viſits, and <hi>Anſelme</hi> with much familiarity did ſomtimes ſtay by the by, to jeſt with <hi>Dorlla,</hi> with cunning ſlights, who being taken I know not how with him, ſuffer'd not one to paſs without giving him an anſwer; yet ſhe one day reſented a peece of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48268:35"/>treachery: when <hi>Anſelmo</hi> told her, I perceive very well now, <hi>Dorilla,</hi> why you are ſo coy towards me, why do you not love me; why do I not love you, ſaid ſhe, for my part I could wiſh to ſee you languiſhing as <hi>Gernando</hi> is; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a wink her cheeks bluſhing, ſhe added, then ſhould you not finde me ſo cruel, as <hi>Roſalba</hi> is: theſe laſt words ſeem'd to <hi>Anſelmo</hi> as the words of an Oracle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the ſecret of <hi>Gernando</hi>'s hidden infirmity: whereupon without any more to do, running quickly to his bed, he findes him raviſhed in <hi>Roſalba</hi>'s eyes, who ſtood by <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Celinda,</hi> who were to no purpoſe on either ſide of him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting him to take away that ſtrange melancholy from his heart, which for his unknown paſſion occaſioned in them ſo manifeſt a grief, and attentively obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, he clearly verified <hi>Dorilla</hi>'s enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma: whereupon having made the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that all ſhould go out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he begins: Is the love then of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmo</hi> ſo little known to thee, that out of idle reſpects, thou doubteſt to diſcover it to me; at laſt I have found it out, thy heart is wounded, the ſhaft comes from <hi>Reſalba,</hi> and it ſhall be my care, that ſhe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48268:35"/>who gave it ſhall cure thy wound: be comforted therefore my friend, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thee to thy ſelf, keep us with you for your uſual comfort: the ſoul of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> being vaniſh'd at his words, was in great danger to be drown'd in love, which roſe up from the bottom of his heart, ſwelling, and changing the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing mans countenance. He bluſhes, grows pale, trembles, freezeth; but at laſt having recover'd his ſpirits, he with a trembling voice anſwers. Out of reſpect that I would not violate, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in my thoughts the Religious bonds of our friendſhip, I have thus ſilenc'd my ſelf even to death. Why alas were you ſo ſcrupulous, replyed <hi>Anſelmo; Reſalba</hi> is a ſervant, not a wife, and do you beleeve that I ſhould take to heart a vain opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her honor, more then you, who are a part of my ſelf, who perhaps with an imaginary fancy inwardly laughs at it. At a call <hi>Reſalba</hi> comes in again with the Ladies, when he goes out purpoſely to bind the practice of his undertakings with <hi>Dorilla</hi> the ſtronger and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ſhort, to deſire of her a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable help to the needs of <hi>Gernando;</hi> he had <hi>Dorilla</hi>'s anſwer, that if another
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48268:36"/>ſhould languiſh for him, whether by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſwaſion would you your ſelf gratifie her: well then replies he, I now underſtand thee, <hi>Dorilla,</hi> &amp; find my ſelf ſo oblig'd by the dear pawn of thy love to love thee, that I wiſh thy deſire, ſo as <hi>Roſalba</hi> by thy means may but relieve <hi>Gernando.</hi> Thee, <hi>Dorilla</hi> reſplendantly for the reward of her ſuffer'd love, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeem'd to her an age, to ciment the undertaking, to gain <hi>Raſalba</hi>'s conſent, that rock wherein ſhe knew ſhe ſhould finde the living life of her heart: So that having taking the firſt opportunity, ſhe afar off, of her ſelf begins to deteſt the miſerable condition of their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which deſtinated them to deny their own, for to follow the will of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which not onely the indiſcreet commands of their Miſtriſſes witneſſed to them, but of others alſo, who would have precedence over them, and indeed ought rather to be their companions then ſervants; whereupon with diſdain, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Anſelmo, Anſelmo</hi> thy Maſter, O <hi>Roſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> rebelling yeſterday againſt the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of due modeſty, grew to that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to deſire me. And what weighs as much with me, he hath preſt me to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48268:36"/>paſs civility with thee, foraſmuch as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting thy honor, that thou thy ſelf ſhould give thy ſelf to <hi>Gernando,</hi> who truly dies languiſhing for thee. God forbid that I ſhould ever do it, I would rather for ever part from this houſe. Thou groweſt angry, <hi>Dorilla,</hi> replyes <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalba,</hi> and art not aware that our Maſters do it to try our conſtancies, they do it to make ſport with us, and thus they treacherouſly pitch their nets to catch the fooliſheſt, when they brag they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer moſt, and die for love; when they intend to tyrannize it over another, they point the line another way, they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſigne with Characters of gold, the firſt expreſſion of their loves, with griefs, O <hi>Dorilla,</hi> not with words, they give us an aſſured teſtimony of the gift which they ſay they have made of their hearts: &amp; truſt me ſiſter, who gives not preſents certainly he loves not. Upon this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal <hi>Dorilla</hi> ſeem'd for the time ſatisfied, as having ſteer'd to that port, where was the principal traffick of her hopes. And ſuddenly with <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> who was at the catch, not far off; glowing with deſire, ſhe communicates the avaritious ſenſe of <hi>Roſalba,</hi> with ſolid pretences, that ſhe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48268:37"/>would be gotten with three hundred peeces of gold, for the firſt pawn of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi>'s amorous affection, and the ſooner to gain her by example, ſhe tels her from the beginning, the carriage of her loves with <hi>Anſelmo: Roſalba</hi> ſeeing that ſhe had already ſold that at a great rate, which in her heart ſhe very willingly would have given, begins by degrees to decline from her faigned rigor, and more freely to contract with <hi>Dorilla;</hi> the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her love propoſition, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a cloke of charity the impurity of her affections, ſhe proteſted ſhe would come as a victim to the Altar, to expiate the crime, and implore his favour, whom ſhe had ſo much offended for his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of her. And having expreſly made the agreement, there was no more to do. By this promis'd comfort, <hi>Gernando</hi> being recover'd, they were ſo to order the buſineſs, that their amorous theft might be hid. Neither could <hi>Anſelmo</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies fail to afford <hi>Dorilla</hi> her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reward, that he might not loſe his own ſatisfaction, who even alſo, long'd to be in the liſts of his hoped for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. He at once was a lover, and a procurer; So that if by his means <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48268:37"/>enjoy'd the love of <hi>Roſalba</hi> his Gentlewoman, he by way of exchange was to enjoy <hi>Dorilla,</hi> Gentlewoman to <hi>Gernando:</hi> whereupon with their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved taking advice, they conſulted on the beſt meanes, what way they might the moſt ſecretly injoy one another; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral councels interven'd, but amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it was beleeved to be the beſt; that <hi>Anſelmo</hi> and <hi>Gernando,</hi> faigning buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſport, ſhould go out of Town, and at night ſecretly return, and changing the keys of their garden doors, ſhould thereby get acceſs into one the others houſe, &amp; going up the back ſtairs to their loves, they every one, might hapily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy till morning the fruits of their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſpiracy. At this only remedy (O the great miracle of love) <hi>Gernando</hi> grew quickly well, and went about this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice with ſo much warineſs, that neither <hi>Leonora</hi> nor <hi>Celinda,</hi> although at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the day, they ſtole and took turns, yet they were not at all awares. At laſt their husbands new delights en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, in prejudice of their abandon'd wives, and whether it be a defect of our humanity, that it prizeth not long, what it poſſeſſeth in abundance, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48268:38"/>it be the vice of ſenſe which findes a greater pleaſure, where love hath more of the impudent. Their wives at laſt grew ſo diſguſtful to them, that when out of cunning they viſited their marriage beds, yet they brought with them ſuch a coldneſs, and inoffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous converſation; which forc'd them to reflect on their great loſſes, they could not but at leaſt be induc'd to beleeve that ſom impudent wenches, faſcinating their husbands, had with their impure laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs turn'd their hearts in their breſts; ſo much were they chang'd from their firſt loves: whereupon <hi>Leonora,</hi> who was of a more reſenting and wary genius then <hi>Celinda,</hi> looking on it with a neerer application, firſt in all <hi>Gernando</hi>'s actions, it ſeem'd as if a certain treating or cypher, a kinde of ſpeaking by ſigns, which he daily held, under cover of a youthful familiarity with <hi>Dorilla,</hi> might if it were well underſtood, take away the Curtain from the Tragedy of all her contentment: whence one day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, tha according to his wonted preſence he was with <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> to go out of Town, <hi>Gernando</hi> practis'd more then uſually with <hi>Dorilla</hi> their miſterious
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48268:38"/>language, whence preſently entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a high ſuſpition, ſhe therupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to watch her all that night, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerving her waies, whoſe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by a narrow door communicated a paſſage into hers; having gotten that opportunity which ſhe moſt deſired, ſo that intending all her motions at the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſhe perceiv'd that about midnight a perſon entring in the dark, was dearly, but ſilently receiv'd by <hi>Dorilla;</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively giving ear at the door, it ſeem'd with an unhappy equivoke, ſhe took it to be the voice by that amorous recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although very low, of <hi>Gernando,</hi> and by the alternate murmor of kiſſes, and ſighs, which by degrees from their more fervent carreſſes the lovers reſounded, thinking ſhe had ſufficiently found out the thief, who unworthily robbing her of her husbands love, transfixed her through the moſt ſenſible part of her bowels, burning wholly with jealouſie, the enrag'd woman ſometimes rais'd her ſelf againſt <hi>Gernando,</hi> and then againſt <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla,</hi> machinating revenge. A thouſand times ſhe was going to diſcover them, and ſhew forth their ſhame; but then again being counſell'd by all kinds of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48268:39"/>reſpects, ſhe was diſturbedly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unreſolv'd in the atrocity of the moſt deſperate diſtractions; at laſt having not courage enough any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to hear the others ſports, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the loſs and breath of her dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt joyes. She went off confus'd and grieved, and fell on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring bed, where till morning preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating her ſelf like a fury, her agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuffer'd her not to cloſe her eyes, yet wearineſs had at laſt overcome her, had not <hi>Celinda</hi> unexpectedly knock'd at the door, and call'd her afreſh to the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſenſe of her firſt grief, with her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed familiarity, ſhe enters the Chamber, and deſires her not to ſtir from her bed, and withal intreats her kindly to admit of the importunity, which their mutual confidence imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd her at that time to give her; and then begins, <hi>Madam,</hi> my heart is ſo full of horror, that did I not fly to clear my doubts to the tranquility of your dear converſation, I beleeve truly my heart would have broken. But now ſleeping, I dream'd, that as you were delighting your ſelf in a thick Forreſt, according to your cuſtome with your gun, courted
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48268:39"/>by your <hi>Gernando,</hi> and my <hi>Anſelmo</hi> and my ſelf, when with the greateſt delight we applauded your triumphs: Behold! The heaven obſcures it ſelf in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt! And out of the ſhades, behold a Lion iſſues! And falling on my <hi>Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> throws him down, whence turning to <hi>Gernando,</hi> who too, aſſaulting him, threatning to glory in his death, when you readily coming to his relief, ſtruck boldly againſt the beaſt; but alas, your ſelf wounded <hi>Gernando</hi> to death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the firce beaſt diſdaining to fight with the dying, furiouſly aſſails, and kills you; So that whilſt I ſmote my breſt and was crying out for help, half dead I did awake. But ſo troubl'd and confus'd, that ſtill floating betwixt truth and doubt of this unhappy ſucceſs; I have been thus, and perhaps too importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately carried hether to you: Prais'd be Heaven O <hi>Celinda,</hi> anſwered <hi>Leoncra,</hi> that the ſlaughters are vaniſh'd, and pray God with them all ſiniſter preſages may do ſo too; but alas, there remains far more grievous images, more lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in my breſt, then you ever had ſleeping in your dreams, which I have had watching all night, and which I have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48268:40"/>heard with mine ears. We are betray'd, <hi>Celinda,</hi> I know that the impudent <hi>Doril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> raviſheth my <hi>Gernando</hi> from my boſom. As on the other ſide, I conclude that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalba</hi> takes away from you your <hi>Anſelmo:</hi> Let's up and think of a remedy on ſome ſharpe revenge, and then from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning relating the Hiſtory of her firſt ſuſpitions, and the manner how ſhe certified her ſelf, of their practice ſhe inſtill'd ſo much diſdain in <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>'s breſt, that maturing it with judgment, ſhe renders her an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Companion to any undertaking: They went to very ſtrict waies, and at laſt concluded that diſſembling their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rankor, they ſhould both prepare at the firſt night of their husbands fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned departure, to change upon ſome colour their own beds with their ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſervants; not onely that they might in the dark with the more ſavory car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes enjoy by this innocent cheat their own husbands with the ſweeter content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that either of them at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhould gently diſcover themſelves, convincing their diſloyal husbands, with the like approved delights, that they had no reaſon to counterpoiſe by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48268:40"/>this amorous recreation, dearly obliging them thereby to caſt off their injurious rivals. Five dayes were ſcarce paſt, when the deſired night came. The two Cavaliers parted that they might ſoon return to their appointments, when their wives peſently began to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their deſignes. <hi>Celinda</hi> commands <hi>Roſalba</hi> that changing beds for that night, ſhe ſhould go lie in hers, for that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous of reſt, intended to get far from the noiſe of the ſtreet, but finding ſome difficulty in being obey'd, ſhe was faign to uſe her authority: <hi>Dorilla</hi> obey'd more then willingly too <hi>Leonora,</hi> arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo much to her ſelf the affection of <hi>Anſelmo,</hi> ſhe doubted not at all to looſe him for the love of another; but rather thought to legitimate her eſcape by her Ladies fault, and efficatiouſly went to effect it to that end, that at laſt being freed from fear of her reproofs, ſhe might enjoy them under that protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At midnight the Lovers according to their cuſtom came, and beleeving as they conceiv'd to enjoy their wonted embraces, they found themſelves after ſuch a manner carreſſed with ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that they found themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48268:41"/>to correſpond with far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions then uſual. For that their wives knowing the perſons they were to act, put by the ſeriouſneſs of marriage, and let themſelves looſe to the exceſſes of an impudent laſciviouſneſs, not onely by not contradicting any amorous propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by invitation, fore-runing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way what they thought would moſt augment the pleaſure of their ſuppoſed Huſbands. To conclude, they would give them proofs of the knowledge, that 'twas not the ſubſtance of truth, but an heretical opinion which perſwaded them they found more pleaſures in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which made them tranſgreſs the legitimacy of their loves.</p>
            <p>Now the courſe of the hours towards morning run apace, when <hi>Gernando</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the white flank of <hi>Roſalba</hi> with his hand the riſe of a certain pretty mole ſhe had there, which was the incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and delights of his highly priz'd pleaſures; not finding it as he was wont, he awhile remain'd aſtoniſh'd with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where revolving certain perticulars in his minde, he thought that as it was, without a voluntary crime, if inſteed of <hi>Roſalba</hi> he might have enjoy'd <hi>Celinda
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48268:41"/>Anſelmo</hi>'s wife; ſo <hi>Anſelmo</hi> by a ſtudied perfidiouſneſs, inſteed of <hi>Dorilla,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps did enjoy his wife <hi>Leonora;</hi> whence upon the urgency of ſo weighty a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hardly ſuppreſſing the grinding of his diſdain, without even bidding her farewel, he clothes himſelf and away; <hi>Celinda</hi> perceived it, but penetrates not the Occaſion of his alteration whom ſhe truly beleeved her husband, whence ſhe thought it not much to hazard that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with him which <hi>Leonora</hi> and ſhe had preordained, that they might regain their husbands loſt affections. He quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goes with his naked ſword to the Chamber where <hi>Anſelmo</hi> uſed to uſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla,</hi> and finding the door ſhut, ſtopt a while at the threſhold to certifie himſelf the better, the Chamber was enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the full rays of the Moon, and ſent forth ſuch a doubtful light, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the pre-dominion of darkneſs, ſo that he could not ſo clearly ſee, but yet diſtinctly hear. Beleeving her husband ſufficiently diſpos'd, by her treatment amorouſly diſcovering her voice, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; perhaps thou haſt wanted nothing this night my dear that thou ſhouldeſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48268:42"/>ſeek contentment abroad, I am thy <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora. Gernando</hi> was no longer in doubt, but furiouſly precipitating himſelf in the Chamber, he cries; what am I thus betraid? And at the ſame time with a furious thruſt he runs <hi>Anſelmo</hi> through, who till then was ſtupified at <hi>Leonora</hi>'s unexpected language, being riſen up to ſit on the bed, falls again, expiring on the ground; and whilſt in the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſhades he ſeeks to kill him; Behold! <hi>Leonora,</hi> who beleeving the wounded's voice, that of the wounder, and from the opinion ſhe had, that ſhe had certainly lain with <hi>Gernando,</hi> and that he was betraid; having taken up a ſcru'd gun, which was hung on a naile neer the bed for their uſe, ſhe ſtrikes a fatal blow to revenge <hi>Gernando</hi>'s death, and therewith kills even her <hi>Gernando:</hi> She ſtrikes him to death in the mid'ſt of his forehead; They both ſuffer'd the pangs of death, and ſhe remain'd blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and even without a ſoul. When <hi>Dorilla</hi> being awakened by the noiſe, takes the Candle which burnt for an Offering before the improvident <hi>Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> Goddeſs, and running to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48268:42"/>ſhe ſhows out of the darkneſs to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora</hi> her complicated errors, which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt her that night both an Adultereſs, a Murthereſs, and Traitereſs, although unvolontarily of the honor, of the Faith and Life of her dear <hi>Gernando.</hi> Being immoveable at the horror of this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, as if ſhe had been of Marble, retired into her ſelf, that it might be Eternized with her; Her Grief and Lamentations filently meditated, and reſolv'd I know not what of fierce and formidable: when on a ſudden ſhe takes, like Lightning, the Sword out of her dying Husbands hands, and laying the Pomel againſt the ground, furiouſly Crying out, O <hi>Gernando, Gernando!</hi> She falls on the Point, yet reaking with <hi>Anſelmo</hi>'s Blood, thus run through, ſhe alſo expires.</p>
            <p>From this ſad cauſe occaſioned by the concourſe of ſo many unhappy deceits. <hi>Celinda</hi> being imform'd, ſhe dyes not of Grief; yet at leaſt dyes to all Comfort, leading ſtill a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable life in <hi>Naples.</hi> And who knows, If Heaven by her long A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony would not ſtill intimate to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Men, That all Friendſhip, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>RMIDORO a young man of <hi>Palermo,</hi> was about ſome buſineſs of his own at <hi>Piſa,</hi> who upon an evening, it being the hotteſt ſeaſon of the year, when men are fore'd to make day of night, goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, taking a Spaniſh Gittar, playing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48268:44"/>upon it, according to the cuſtom of his Country; having a while after this manner walked about the Town, at the head of a ſtreet which ended on the Banks of the <hi>Arno,</hi> he heard himſelf call'd from a houſe, with theſe words; Is it you? <hi>Armidoro,</hi> who was a caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous young man, and thought it might be ſome love trick; Yes that it is: then ſhe entreated him to come up; the heedleſs young man without thinking of harm, comes to the door, which he findes open, enters the houſe, and being come up ſtaires into a great Hall, perſently found himſelf incompaſſed by three young men, which were brethren, who aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with their naked ſwords, ſaid, O thou villain, now ſhall we reward thee for violating our ſiſters honor; <hi>Armido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> although he was ſomewhat ſtartled at ſo unlook'd for an accident, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he was taken for another man, he takes heart and ſays: Hold! Sirs, for I am not the young man you ſeek: The young men thereupon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held their hands; and one of them ſaid, what art not thou he which didſt com to ſhame our Family, introduc'd to ſerve our ſiſters lechery? I (reply'd <hi>Armidore</hi>) am a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48268:44"/>young <hi>Silician,</hi> who ſtay here for ſome affairs of mine, and am within a few daies to return to my Countrey; I know not who you are, nor who is your ſiſter, I came up here becauſe I was call'd, and I thought I might with ſecurity come in a Country, where there is no wrong done to to any man. An old man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon in, the young mens Father; Let <hi>Liſetta</hi> ſays he, be call'd. She comes: She was a moſt beautiful young Lady, of about fifteen years of age. To whom the old man turn'd, ſaying, Is this that wicked fellow that lyes with you? <hi>Liſetta</hi> at this queſtion, her looks were enflam'd like a burning fire-brand, and looking ſtedfaſtly upon <hi>Armidoro,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſhe had never ſeen him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the old man was going to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes and ſend away, <hi>Armidoro,</hi> but that one of the young men ſaid, it ought no wayes to be done: If ſays he, he goes alive from hence, he will diſcover our ſhame to the world; let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore die, and let his blood cover our fault: But the old man giving his ſon good words, ſaid, that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cover their errors with the blood of innocents; for that as many drops of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48268:45"/>blood as the innocent's wounds ſhould bleed, they would prove as many tongues, which ſhould call the Divine Juſtice to vengeance, and to the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their wickedneſs: whereupon, <hi>Armidoro,</hi> without any more to do was licenc'd, being onely perſwaded to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy. The young man being come out of doors, and having perceiv'd that he had eſcap'd a great danger, was reſolv'd for that night to adventure himſelf no more, taking his way to his own lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; where being arriv'd, and his hand already on the door opening it to go in, he unexpectedly felt himſelf aſſaulted, by a blow behinde, which hardly miſt his head, followed with theſe words; Traytor, hold, Traytor. <hi>Armidoro,</hi> who was a reſolute young man, and of a great courage, preſently draws his ſword, and turning upon him who had wounded him: Thou lyeſt, he cries out, What Traytor was I ever? Thus the diſpute began equally betwixt them. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known man happened to be deeply wounded in the throat, and in the flank, ſo that thinking himſelf dead, he caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his arms, and begg'd <hi>Armidoro</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. He that knew not why they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48268:45"/>fought, not onely gave it him, but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know who he was, went himſelf to finde the next Chirurgion, to come to his cure. Now when the Chirurgion was ſearching the wounds of this unknown Cavalier, he was found to be <hi>Riccardo,</hi> a noble young man of <hi>Piſa; Armidoro</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him the reaſon, why he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner provok'd him? The reaſon was, reply'd <hi>Riccardo,</hi> an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Jealouſie; I ought that night, ſays he, to have gone to the houſe where you were, for the intereſt of Love; by my Miſtriſſes appointment I was to paſs through the ſtreets playing, after the ſame manner as you did; now having ſeen you paſs before my houſe, out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity I followed you, and ſeeing you enter and ſtay a good while in <hi>Liſetta</hi>'s houſe, I thought you had enjoy'd her; whereupon, being enrag'd, I reſolv'd in my heat to murther you, but Fortune would not ſecond the malignity of my will; foraſmuch as you had reaſon on your ſide, every man having reaſon to take the good things which occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. <hi>Armidoro</hi> knowing by <hi>Riccardo</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the true occaſion of what had befaln him, and thinking, that perhaps
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48268:46"/>it might draw out of trouble a whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, if he took the way which Fortune afforded him for its deliverance. He tells <hi>Riccardo,</hi> that if he lov'd <hi>Liſetta,</hi> as it ſeem'd he did, why did he not ask her in marriage? <hi>Riccardo</hi> anſwer'd, that he thought to have done it, but ſince that ſhe committed with other men, he would ſee her no more. <hi>Armidoro</hi> having hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly got him to his home, which was not far from <hi>Liſetta</hi>'s houſe, his wounds being already dreſt, promiſing a ſudden cure, he relates to him what had befaln him, and withal the danger wherein he had ſeen <hi>Liſetta,</hi> unleſs ſhe were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently helped by ſome ſpeedy reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that if he thought well of it, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>would go and demand her of her parents for him to wife, which being granted, all occaſions of diſtaſt would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſe. <hi>Riccardo</hi> being very glad to hear, aſwel that <hi>Liſetta</hi> had not falſified her faith, as above meaſure he was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the diſcovery of his love practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, anſwer'd <hi>Armidoro,</hi> that he wholly remitted the whole managing of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to him. Now as <hi>Armidoro</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his way to the houſe of <hi>Coſmo,</hi> for ſo was the old man <hi>Liſetta</hi>'s father call'd,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48268:46"/>he meets a maid, who was ſecretly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of the houſe, to finde out <hi>Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo,</hi> to advertiſe him of <hi>Liſetta</hi>'s dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to intreat him, as guilty of thoſe practiſes, to relieve her. He knew from her that <hi>Liſetta</hi>'s eldeſt brother, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſio,</hi> had that day entred her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and found her reading a letter, which he ſnatch'd out of her hand; wherein was written, as followeth.</p>

               <p>Aurelia <hi>carefully obſerveth the behaviour of her daughter the love ſick</hi> Ermelina; <hi>and at laſt finding a love letter about her, falls in love with her Lover, whom (faining her ſelf</hi> Ermelina) <hi>ſhe invites to her bed; but deceiv'd by another, gives way to her daughters, being enjoy'd; whereupon, finally they both marry.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>AURELIA was daughter to the Prince of <hi>Ancaſtle,</hi> and ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endued with the goods of the Minde, of the Body, and of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; that ſhe ſcarce attain'd to her
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48268:48"/>thirteenth year, but ſhe rais'd the hopes of many, who pretended to aſpire to the poſſeſſion of ſo great a treaſure: And although her Fathers wealth, mov'd the avarice of ſome to ſeek her in marriage; beſides the beauty of her countenance, which tiraniz'd over the affections of all, ſo that favor'd by all the Graces, ſhe was reckon'd their inferiour in nothing but number.</p>
            <p>The aſcenſion to this amorous heaven was granted to <hi>Edoardo,</hi> the nobleſt, but oldeſt of all her pretenders. The fate of thoſe <hi>Aurora</hi>'s, who are onely poſſeſt by the <hi>Titons.</hi> This union appear'd to the world monſtrous, which did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>Edoardo</hi> fitter for his grave, then a Nuptial bed. He was in his three and fiftieth year, which with the winter, which he wore in the wrinkles of his face, and on the ſnow of his hair, to the belief or all, rendred this union neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily harſh with this ſpring of beauty, which was without fruit or flower. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi> readily applyes her ſelf to the cold embraces of an old man, and their age affording them no higher deſires, ſhe plac'd the comforts of her marriage in the riches of her habit, the choice of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48268:49"/>her jewels, the abundance of her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and number of her ſervants, with her continual attendance on her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Who already grown jealous, thought himſelf never ſecure of her, when ſhe was but out of ſight. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual practice oblig'd <hi>Edoardo</hi> to many, and often endeavours, and taskes beyond his ſtrength and age; ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of his marriage terminated with that of his funeral. <hi>Edoardo</hi>'s death was accompanied with ſuch ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his loving wife, that wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ſighing, mourning, and tearing her hair, were the leaſt arguments of her grief. She would even have gone with him to the grave, had ſhe not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, how neer ſhe was to the time of her delivery, which flatter'd her with the hopes to revive him again in the birth of a ſon. But her deſires were betray'd by the birth of a girle, who yet (in her very ſwath-bands) forc'd all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her to a hight and ſingular opinion of a threatning beauty. <hi>Aurelia</hi> would not ſo much as give ear to any, ſo far was her heart, from beleeving, but that all thoſe who could ever felicitate her, were dead with her <hi>Edoardo.</hi> She voluntarily bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48268:49"/>her ſelf in her houſe, intending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the inſtruction of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but with ſo ſtrict a diſcipline, that ſhe was already advanced to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of her age, and could not yet brag to have ſeen, or to have been ſeen by any other men, but thoſe who were of the Family. She never went abroad but twice or thrice in a year, and then ſo covered and watch'd with ſuch a care, leaſt even the air onely might raviſh her. Her chamber ſcarce gave admittance to the Sun, ſo far was it from the eyes of mortal men. And then the continual company of her mother, permitted no other divertiſement, but ſom ſometimes childiſh paſtimes.</p>
            <p>Fortune the ordinary helper of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, operated ſo, that <hi>Aurelia</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melina,</hi> for ſo was the daughter call'd, were violently carried to the window, by a great noiſe, which by how much the more violent it was, by ſo much it rendred them the more curious. They ſaw the life of <hi>Alexio</hi> their neighbour aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſcinated by the ſwords of many, whilſt he defended himſelf with a courage far beyond his age. The youth and beauty of <hi>Alexio</hi> mov'd a fudden pitty in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48268:50"/>breſt of <hi>Aurelia;</hi> ſo that commanding her ſervants to let him in, they free'd him from the hands of the others; who having wounded him in one hand, and grievouſly in the flank, were even ready to murther him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexio</hi> after ſome ſhort complements, was eaſily invited to reſt himſelf in bed. Hether was his mother brought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his recovery; the Phyſitians deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſtir from that houſe, leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and air might the more exaſperate his wounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ermelina</hi> altogether ignorant of love, whoſe name was even unknown to her; loſt her ſelf at the firſt ſight of <hi>Alexio;</hi> being altogether ignorant of love, ſhe fals in love; neither could ſhe contend againſt the firſt ſtruglings of love; ſo that now with a curious ear ſhe attends the diſcourſe of the Phyſitian, and now ſhe enquires of the ſervants; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though very often reprov'd by her Mother; ſhe ſlips into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, masking under pretty pretences, the deſire ſhe had to ſee him. The nights increas'd her diſquiets, ſleep wanting ſtrength to ſtill her agitations; that at laſt her minde is tiranniz'd by a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48268:50"/>of thoughts; and if at any time, her eyes overcom with watching, not with ſleep yeelded, they preſently open'd to them other fantaſms, which tormented her even more ſlumbring then waking. <hi>Ermelina</hi> entertains her ſelf for ſome daies in this amorous phrenſie, till <hi>Alexio</hi> upon his recovery, recovers his own houſe. He had often obſerv'd in the Girles eyes ſome pretty teſtimony, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of love, then of Pitty. But being little practis'd, he condemn'd all thoſe thoughts as ſuſpected, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him he was belov'd. But fed with the incitements of that beauty, which would render all undertakings excuſable, and keeping houſe the better to confirm his recovery, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recreated himſelf at a Window, which anſwer'd <hi>Ermelina</hi>'s Chamber. There ſhe readily diſcover'd, how he mov'd by a thouſand impatiences, made no other vowes, but to ſee her: Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a way to open a window oppoſite to her lovers, which had been adviſedly ſhut up by her Mothers jealouſie, ſhe took occaſion to ſee him at her pleaſure; but was forbid to ſpeak with him, either by her own modeſty, or the fear of her
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48268:51"/>Mother. He alſo by his treacherous love, being rendred mute, gave his eyes theli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of all the functions of his tongue. At laſt overcoming himſelf; he in Paper exhales his Paſſions: Thus expreſſing himſelf.</p>

            <p>This letter was convoyed to <hi>Ermelina</hi> without difficulty, for having expected the occaſion, as ſhe was looking out of the Window he darted it gently to her breſt. The Girl no leſs curious then amorous, took liberty, and ſtrait her eyes ran to the reading of it; whilſt her ſoul was raviſh'd with theſe Characters, ſhe minds not her Mothers obſerving her, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment examin'd and cenſur'd the actions and paſſages of her daughter. The firſt effect of <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s deſpight, was, to ſnatch the letter out of her hand, adding ſo many injuries and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, that tears and ſighs were the leaſt witneſſes of <hi>Ermelina</hi>'s ſufferings.

Scarce did ſhe know it to be <hi>Alexio's,</hi> but her minde was agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a thouſand thoughts. Youth and Beauty made way for deſire to gain poſſeſſion. Repentance aſſaulted her, to have ſo many years neglected her life from the enjoyment thereof; all other pleaſures were too apparent, beſides thoſe which a conjugal love produceth. On the other ſide, ſhe miſdoubted the free cenſure of the world, in taking ſuch a reſolution, after thirteen years ſtay; She fear'd her daughters temerity, and the tender youth of <hi>Alexio;</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that a ſecond Marriage, after having ſo long regretted the firſt, was but to incur the bold cenſure of fame, and a voluntary looſing of her liberty. That part prevails in our affection over which ſenſe is moſt predominant; ſhe reſolves to loſe all, rather then the love of <hi>Alexio.</hi> Taking her Pen; in her daughters name, ſhe thus invites him.</p>

            <p>This letter having been ſubtilly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the hands of <hi>Alexio,</hi> inſteed to rejoyce him, rais'd a confuſion of thoughts in his minde and bereft him of his reſt, were it either out of his little practiſe in love matters, or that he ſaw the poſſeſſion of the fair ſo eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, which he valued by ſo much the more, as he ſuppoſed the acceſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, he confeſſed himſelf penitent to have advanced ſo far. Whilſt without reſolution he was thus ſolicited with a thouſand doubts, the Count of <hi>Bellombra</hi> came to viſit and entertain himſelf with him, a youth of a great birth but of a mean fortune; at firſt encounter having diſcovered <hi>Alexio</hi> agitated with ſome paſſion, he with ſome reſentment and extraordinary commotion enquires the cauſe. <hi>Alexio</hi> with a like facility both in being diſturb'd, and in diſcovering of it, communicates all the motives to the Count, which engaged him in thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his minde, deſiring him as a friend
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48268:53"/>by his adviſe to reduce him to the beſt reſolution. The Count perſwading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that it was a good occaſion to better his own condition, and coveting that for himſelf which was offered to another, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth <hi>Alexio</hi> not to venture on the invitation of a child, rather deſerving diſdain then love, ſince with ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility ſhe proſtituted her ſelf to the will of a lover; that to introduce one at night, whom ſhe intends for a husband, gave an evident ſign that ſhe had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others: Beſides he being not aſſured of the il which might happen, he run the hazard to loſe himſelf, if following the luſts of his ſenſe he ſhould accept of the offer: he added thereunto ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which meeting with <hi>Alexio</hi>'s little courage, eaſily perſwaded him to reſolve abſolutely to abandon the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; and ſo much the more for that with ſo much difficulty and diſpleaſure her mother had denyed him leave to go from thence. The Count a while after taking leave pretending ſome imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the night being come he goes to <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s Garden door, who received him with open arms beleeving it to be <hi>Alexio;</hi> he being no leſs deceived, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48268:54"/>her to be <hi>Ermelina;</hi> after ſome ſhort complements with a low voice, both fearing to be diſcover'd, without light they retired themſelves to a ground Chamber, where on a narrow pillow they gave their ſenſes liberty to enjoy the fruits of love. At laſt <hi>Ermeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> beleeving her mother drown'd, not in pleaſures, but in ſleep, gets out of her loathed bed, by reaſon of her ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for ſleep, and goes to the window at the very ſame time when <hi>Alexio</hi> was come thither, diſturb'd with no leſs agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <hi>Ermelina</hi> ſometimes ſigh'd both for the injuries ſhe had receiv'd from her mother, and for that ſhe deſpair'd the end of her loves, ſince they had had ſo unfortunate a beginning. <hi>Alexio</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelf that theſe ſighs procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cauſe he had not anſwered her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, &amp; not without violence to himſelf, told her, <hi>Madam,</hi> I know not whether I ſhould complain of Fortune or of my little merit which renders me unworthy to receive the favours of love. <hi>Ermelina</hi> thinking he reprov'd her for not having ſent him an anſwer, replies; Love is the greateſt of all things, and ſince for my ſatisfaction he is unlike himſelf, I know
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48268:54"/>not what to criminate but deſtiny, which will that I ſhould love without hopes. He anſwers, there is no love without hopes, ſince from them alone he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the true ſubſtance of his being. And what would you, ſays ſhe, have me hope, ſince all accidents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire my miſchief to render me deſperat. He replies, to be fully anſweredin love, is it not then enough to quit you here in a full calm. But who aſſures methat, ſays ſhe, the promiſes of Lovers are the frisks of the wind. I, replies <hi>Alexio,</hi> who dedicate my ſelf unto you. Theſe, ſaid <hi>Ermelina,</hi> are words which loſe themſelves in the air where they are fomr'd. You ſhall ſee the effect, ſays he, did I not fear to be too temerous. And what would you do ſaid ſhe. I would get into your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and there conclude our loves, and ſave my heart from the ſhipwrack of hopes and fears. Hereat <hi>Ermelina</hi> pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a while, doubtful whether ſhe ſhould refuſe or receive this offer, and then ſhe tells him, to ſo great a propoſition I have not courage enough at this time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. He who by the vertue of love had caſt off all fear, and cloathing himſelf with boldneſs, which was the more
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48268:55"/>hightned perceiving himſelf paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lov'd, Anſwers her. Who will be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, loves, not love admits of no conſults, and in love matters all that is deferred is loſt: there was no way left, either ſhe muſt grant his demand, or confeſs ſhe lov'd him not. <hi>Ermelina</hi> anſwered, although my deſire to be yours is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my expreſſion, I can never conſent that you ſhould reſolv to enter this caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bring equally your reputation and my life in danger. <hi>Alexio</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe words were rather injurious, although they ſeem'd denials; by the help of a ſtool climb'd to <hi>Ermelina</hi>'s win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſo enters the Chamber: there after ſome faign'd diſdains and repulſes, which the more incited him, <hi>Ermelina</hi> was content he ſhould reap thoſe fruits which Lovers moſt defire.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Aurelia</hi> had partly ſatisfied thoſe itchings, which proceed from no other reaſon but that of fenſe, when fearing leaſt her action might be diſcover'd; leaving the Count to his reſt, ſhe ſoftly viſits the houſe, at laſt ſhe arrived at the furtheſt parts, which was her daughters Chamber, at that time when with a ſtruggling murmur of kiſſes
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48268:55"/>the Lovers were preparing themſelves to new amorous aſſaults. It ſeem'd ſtrange to her that her daughter being in ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an age durſt be ſo bold as to give her ſelf up to the embraces of a lover: But conſidering that errors of love deſerv'd all indulgence, and alſo knowing her ſelf guilty of the ſame eſcapes, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in her ſelf, to diſſemble the faults of others, that ſhe might not diſcover her own: Yet for all this ſhe would needs know who was her daughters choice, whether with a fit election ſhe in ſome ſort civiliz'd her bold reſolution. Scarce did ſhe perceive him to be <hi>Alexio,</hi> when being deceiv'd, beleeving him her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhe ſacrificed her ſelf to fury, rendring her ſelf like thoſe who are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a legion of Spirits; ſhe tears her hair, beats her ſelf, ſtrikes her breſt, neglects no demonſtration to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her diſdain and expreſs her grief; and at laſt with injuries and reproofs ſhe thus declares her paſſion.</p>
            <p>Perfidious man! After having enjoy'd the mother, muſt thou contaminate alſo the daughters innocency. Why did Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Fortune render this wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver ſo lovely. Are theſe the promiſes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48268:56"/>of the love you made me, but now are theſe treacheries, the teſtimonies of thy Faith. O Heavens! I ſhall beleeve your motions inſenſible, and your influences hid if you do not thunderſtrike this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; ſacrilegious fellow. <hi>Ermelina</hi> at the hearing of her mothers words, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her ſelf abuſed by <hi>Alexio;</hi> gives her ſelf over to tears, and crying with ſuch lively declarations of grief, that it would even have entroduc'd pitty into inſenſible things, ſaying.</p>
            <p>Why, O cruel man! Haſt thou betray'd the ſimplicity and innocency of a girle? Why didſt thou deceive me with a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, ſo much the more execrable, as being mask'd with love? When, where, O wicked wretch, haſt thou learn'd theſe inhumane manners, not us'd even by thoſe creatures which heaven endu'd not with reaſon. Pardon theſe effects, dear Mother, where ſenſuality did never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev it ſhould have offended the reaſon of nature, and hindred the ſatisfaction of her who gave me my being.</p>
            <p>She would have continued, had not <hi>Alexio,</hi> who till then remain'd, like a ſtone, immoveable, interrupred her: My <hi>Ermelina,</hi> who misdoubts my
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48268:56"/>Faith, may as well doubt whether I live or no: I declare my ſelf thine, and offer my ſelf ready to authenticate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this vow by marriage, where I will make no delay, but what may ariſe from your want of courage. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of <hi>Aurelia</hi> encreaſed the more at theſe words, whence redoubling her cries, with her hands ſhe flew to ſatisfie the deſire of her paſſion. <hi>Ermelina</hi>'s love permitted her not ſo much forbearance to ſee <hi>Alexio</hi> injur'd without defending him, interpoſeth her ſelf to quiet her mother, but ſhe at every moment recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving new alterations, was ready to take ſome ſtrange reſolution, had not the Count's unexpected arrival ſtopt and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd them. He having ſtaid with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience a long while the return of his miſtris, but not ſeeing her appear, he went out of the Chamber to meet her, not without ſome doubt that her ſtay portended him ſome diſaſter: ſcarce did he hear the outcry, but he the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited the ſuſpition; whereupon with celerity he came where <hi>Aurelia</hi> with tooth and nail vented the fury of her diſdain.

The lye in the mouth of a Girle, replies he, injures not: Beſides the carracters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare you guilty. Saying ſo, he draws out the letter, and beginning to read it, was interrupted by <hi>Alexio;</hi> who told him, faithleſs friend that letter is mine, Its true ſaid the Count; but you refuſing to come, I came in your ſteed and have enjoy'd her with promiſe of Marriage. Then anſwers <hi>Alexio,</hi> muſt <hi>Ermelina</hi> have two husbands; having been upon the ſame pretence enjoyed by me. <hi>Aurelia</hi> finding that ſhe had been deceived, intending to deceive, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that the publication of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhould ſerve for the idle entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publick diſcourſe, tells the Count and <hi>Alexio;</hi> Sirs, if with actions worthy of Cavaliers you will keep your words to marry, I will do ſo, that who you have enjoy'd ſhall be yours.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>ON The River of <hi>Genuoa,</hi> there dwelt a Lady of a mean beauty, but endew'd with ſo many good graces, and ſuch ſweetneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that ſhe raviſh'd the affections of all who beheld her, together with their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48268:58"/>liberties. She was wooed and courted by many Cavaliers, which if they were not ſatisfied with a compleat correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet were they anſwered with a diſcreet rigour: ſhe rendred her ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lovely in her refuſals, her ſeverity being clothed with ſo gracious a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, oblig'd mindes, even in tormenting them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Niarpe</hi> onely, a youth of a moſt lively ſpirit, and of high blood, was favour'd by heaven to deſerve her love, which was long'd for by many, even with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Whether it were his happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, or the ſweet violence of the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of his Genius: he at firſt, ſcarce without ſeeking it, gain'd the reciprocal affection of <hi>Euridea,</hi> for ſo was the Lady call'd. Sighs laſted not long, their air wanted none, ſince he ſcarce entred the Sea of Love, but he happily arrives at the port: He was rais'd to pleaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſenſible of pain, taſting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without wormwood, which uſually prevents or accompanies the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lovers. A long time was ſpent whilſt he deliciated himſelf, cauſing the envious to murmur at his fortune, and at the partiality of Love, who directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48268:59"/>appear'd ſo cruel towards them. Now they being guided by proſperity, ſo ordered their daies, that with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary delights their life did flow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in amorous dalliance.</p>
            <p>But at laſt Fortune who is Loves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, to give tryal of her wonted changeableneſs, with an unthought of accident, diſturb'd the happieſt peace of theſe bleſſed Lovers. Whilſt one night amongſt others they ſlept together, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving buried their ſences in ſo much the more profound a reſt, the ſatisfaction of their deſires had the more open'd their breſts to enjoy a moſt ſweet repoſe, the fantaſms of <hi>Euridea</hi> were diſturb'd by melancholy humors which engag'd her minde in the horrors of a dream.</p>
            <p>Which preſented her with a frightful treachery, which made one appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, who with his Steel threatned to murther her; all was troubled in her ſpirit, which eaſily gave credit to thoſe ſhaddows of terror, which ſolicited her tongue to call for help with outcries. Aloud ſhe caſts forth theſe accents.</p>
            <p>Alas, I am betray'd. Who will help me? Her Lover being ſuddenly wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the noiſe, yet his waking gave
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48268:59"/>him not leave ſo well to diſcern the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of theſe complaints, but he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeys his affection, which was the life of his motion; now by the vigour thereof, having even ſleeping known the voice of his beloved, ſo that at firſt impulſe he was onely ſolicited to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he takes up his Dagger which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lay at his beds head.</p>
            <p>At which very inſtant the Lady di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with the fright, whilſt at firſt ſhe could not diſtinguiſh whether the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent were true or a dream, caſts her eyes on her beloved, &amp; ſeeing him by the light of a little lamp, which was in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with his naked Dagger, which he held in his hand as to ſtrike a blow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, it being ſuggeſted her by the deceit of the dream, ſhe beleeves it a viſion rather then the fright of an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary appearance. His words, which might have diſcovered the fraud, ſaying; What troubles thee O my dear, were not heard by her, or if heard, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, or beleev'd effects of his diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, wherewith he thought to hide the diſcover'd perfidiouſneſs of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
            <p>At laſt with a ſudden fury intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48268:60"/>with prejudic'd thoughts, which perſwaded her that her Love had an intention to murther her. She raging throws her ſelf out of her bed, and with a cruel diſdain ſeems greedy to tear him in peeces with the ſame hands wherewith formerly ſhe thought ſhe could never be ſatisfied to embrace him; and then with her tongue ſhe ſends forth her ſhreeks, exagerating her exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt <hi>Niarpe.</hi> Perfideous, perverſe, and horrid mutherer, couldſt thou finde no better way to deſpiſe the faith of a Lady beſotted with thy fictions; hadſt thou no other means to bring thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries to paſs, but in the current of my blood; with thy Dagger didſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to imprint the Charracters of the diſdain wherewith thou loatheſt me, perhaps, for being too faithful, and therein unlike unto thee; wouldſt thou thus felicitate our love, and remunerate my fidelity, ungrateful Traytor, fiercer then furies, inhumanity in human like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! What! Aſſault a woman with ſuch Arms; a woman ſleeping, thinking ſhe might ſecurely reſt in her Lovers arms; a woman who lov'd and ſerv'd thee, thinking to diſcover the valew, or
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48268:60"/>at leaſt to deſerve a reward for ſo much love. Whence, where haſt thou learnt examples of ſuch cruelty? Who hath preſcribed rules of ſo much ingratitude? Tell me cruel Infidel infamous that thou art, when did I ever offend, but in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thee too much, whereby have I acquired the proofs of ſo great a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, unleſs for being too kind to thee? I thank the Gods that by an oportune adviſe they have delivered me from thy wounds, if on the other ſide I ſhould not wiſh to have loſt my life, that I might not outlive ſo high an impiety.</p>
            <p>The young man was confus'd, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, nay, confounded at this accident, and both in his colour and immobility ſeem'd of Marble; but that ſomeimes he would open his mouth to make his excuſes, and with truth undeceive thoſe falſe conceptions. But the unbridled rage of <hi>Euridea,</hi> tenacious of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived belief forbad it him; ever when he endeavoured to licence his accents out of the priſon of his lips. Peace ſhe crys out thou baſe man, dare no more to profanate me with thy lying words; in vain thou ſeekeſt a cloak for thy fraud, thy treachery can no longer be hid.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48268:61"/>
            <p>Thoſe of the houſe were already come at her out-cry, to them ſhe relates the occaſion of her complaints. He hath attempted quoth ſhe to kill me whilſt I ſlept, the hand of heaven hath onely delivered and defended me from death. At laſt cries out upon <hi>Niarpe,</hi> get thee thou wretch out of theſe gates contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with excecrable miſchief; out of this houſe, and never even with thy i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination perſwade thy ſelf thou ſhalt be ſuffer'd to reentre; be perpetually ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd my preſence, and may thy exile be puniſhment enough for thy perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And redoubling theſe orders, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him away, while he either heard not, being ſtupified, or diſlik'd, as contrary to his hopes. The Aſſiſtants obſerv'd how <hi>Euridea</hi> grew more furious in her rage, her fires encreaſing which enflam'd her, as the others aſhes redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him pale; ſo that to ſhun worſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters they led her to the remoteſt rooms of the houſe, that ſhe might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear nor ſee the object of her fury, which formerly had been the ſubject of her love delights.</p>
            <p>Thus the poor Lover remain'd I know
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48268:61"/>not with what a ſentiment, if the effect of ſo ſtrange a ſucceſs rendred him not inſenſible, it muſt be thought impoſſible in a heart which was not petrified. In an act of ready defence, thinking to deſerve well, he ſaw the Cataſtrophe of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to the ruine of his felicity, even where otherwiſe he thought to ſecure himſelf. He could not hate the Lady, ſince ſhe was guiltleſs onely in being te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious to ſuch falſe ſuſpitions, a want to be aſcrib'd to the imperfection of her ſex; ſo that he durſt not vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt that diſdain, which though unjuſt did in appearance partly juſtifie her. After many thoughts, at laſt that he might not raiſe higher outcries to raiſ the neighbourhood, he reſolves to obey <hi>Euridea</hi>'s fury: He departs, hoping that the knowledge of the truth would quickly reconcile him with his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>In this condion he expected; two daies baniſh'd by this unlucky accident, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd and ſtupified with this addition, that he deſpair'd to receive any relief. At laſt the thoughts of belief being riſen up, the fervor of anger being abated; he tempts her by means of a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48268:62"/>with a letter which bore this ſence.</p>

            <p>At the onely ſight of the ſubſcription, <hi>Euridea</hi> renews in her looks the pomps of diſdain, and her heats makes proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Faithful and Lover, ſhe exclaims: What Faith, what Love dares this impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fellow yet boaſt of! Whereupon quickly tearing the paper, wherewith her madneſs was not content, but with deſpight ſhe muſt even tread it under her feet: an ill preſage for the young man, who could not hope that his deſires ſhould be granted, that paper being kick'd away wherein all his hopes were included: as under a torch he receives the characters of a new impreſſion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he reads the ſentence of an unretract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able refuſal. Running afterwards over a flood of reproofs againſt the woman
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48268:63"/>who carried the leter, he begins to believ that he was only to condemn that fate which had imbarraſs'd him in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. After repeated injuries which he loaded the poor woman withal, ſhe returns to tempt, if at leaſt ſhe might procure ſome eaſe to the fury of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted paſſions; relating the paſſages, ſhe tells him of the immutable ſtate of her cruelty, deſpairing of any more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing any means able to relieve his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and ſuccour him in his urgency, whence conſequences of death were like to ſucceed. Yet he again tempts by other letters to make his reaſons appear, which by ſeveral deceits he gets delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the hands of <hi>Euridea.</hi> But ſhe being deluded by appearances, judg'd him the more inexcuſable, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery the more true, refuſing for ever to admit of any excuſe of his, in his behalf; on ſuch terms, that ſhe refus'd all let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whatſoever, or receives them with great warineſs, leaſt they ſhould come from him, that ſhe might not be troubled with his noyſom importunities: ſhe even hated his name with the ſiniſter thought of a Traitor; and her ſoul being free by the frauds of deceit, ſhe forbore not to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48268:63"/>love him, abhorring thoſe violences which oblig'd her to diſdain. Whence her minde was plagued, leaving no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance which ſubjected her not to double torments; the one of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his perfidiouſneſs, the other of her impoſſibility of hating him, who ſtill appear'd lovely.</p>
            <p>The afflicted Lover got perſons of her familiar acquaintance, which undertook to undeceive her. To them he ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt his grief, that he even violenc'd them to compaſſionate him, and urg'd his entreaties with ſo much efficacy, that he oblig'd them to grant his requeſts. The reſtraint of his prayers was the compendium of his deſires, to clear his innocency, the witneſs was ſufficient, ſhewing himſelf ſtill ſo paſſionate a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that they could not imagine him a Villanous Homicide. They all promiſed to move for him, to inſinuate in their diſcourſes interceſſions in his favour, which might prove grateful: yet were the iſſues of his hopes vain, the Lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining pertinacious in her rage, who at the leaſt word at a ſuſpition onely which her imagnation ſuggeſted in favor of <hi>Niarpe,</hi> denied to hearken to it, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48268:64"/>flew away that ſhe might not hear it; ſo that ſhe oblig'd them all to ſilence: ſo that in concluſion ſhe would admit of none to come in her preſence, whoſe firſt proteſtations were not abſolute promiſes, never to ſpeak of him; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of him always with the title of ungrateful, with attributes of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. You may imagine to what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſufferings the miſerable man was reduc'd, meeting ſo obſtinate a fierceneſs: The ſtate of the damn'd, as inferiour judgeth the right of this, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the tortures of that ſcorn'd ſoul, by ſuch an accident which pricking him to the life, made the moſt ſpiritual part of his heart reſent it. In this deſperate condition he would a thouſand times have dyed, had not even death appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed horrible, not as to other miſerable perſons deſireable, ſince it muſt have been accompanied with the unaboliſh'd thought of his infidelity. He forc'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to live, becauſe he hoped to ſee Fortune once glutted with her paſtimes, when that tempeſtuous ſea would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come calm, wherein there now appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing but rocks and wracks. Two moneths were paſt, the greateſt part
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48268:64"/>whereof was ſpent in fruitleſs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which open'd the gate to a total deſpair. Heaven at laſt commiſerated the extremity of his torments, ſubmini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring an occaſion and a way to diſcover the unchangeable purity of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as far from treachery, as they were truly neer the extremity of love.</p>
            <p>There din'd with <hi>Euridea</hi> a Lady, a familiar friend of hers, with the height of all the delights which uſually ſecond converſation, eſpecially at meals. The table was not coſtly, yet full ſerv'd with all ſorts of meat, exceeding the terms of ordinary moderation, although they out went them not in ceremony. The courſes of fiſh and fleſh were double, in reſpect that its the cuſtome of ſome who obſerve ſuch a day, with a particular devotion, to abſtain from all but lent meats. <hi>Euridea</hi> was ſo accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and therefore did not accompany her friend in taſting of every diſh, who indifferently fed on all: but moſt of all fed upon a diſh of Muſhroms, which that very noon were (as he who brought them ſaid) ſent by ſome Nunns. In that Country they dreſs them ſeveral wayes, as if a great quantity priviledged with a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48268:65"/>ſingular goodneſs, were not ſufficient, unleſs the diverſity of ſauces did not change their formes, and render them grateful to the pallat. Theſe were dreſt with eggs and cheeſe, and ſuch like things, which caus'd <hi>Euridea</hi> to forbear them: the chance was that they had an inward malign quality which produc'd ſtrange effects in this Ladies ſtomack. A while after dinner being come home, ſhe was aſſaulted with mortal pains, gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the guts, oppreſſion of the heart, which ſent forth over her body a cold ſweat, which uſually denotes the laſt endeavours wherewith Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the violences of death: the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous humors of her ſtomack ſwell'd up her belly, caus'd her eyes to ſtare, made her lips pale, and her mouth foam; all uſual effects of venemous food, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to ſpeak, could not expreſs the truth, nor the ſuſpition of her unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſickneſs. The women about her giving her remedies, as againſt poyſons, forc'd down her throat Treackle diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Wine.</p>
            <p>The remedy operated according to its proper vertue expelling the matter which burthens the complexion, by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48268:65"/>drawing it to the laſt center of its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The women cry out the lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that their Miſtris was poyſon'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating the ſame opinion in her, who approved it as true. Being ſtupified with faintings, occaſioned by the exceſs of her diſeaſe, ſhe till then was exempt from thought; the minde eaſily admits of falſe ſuſpitions upon ſuch an occaſion. So that condemning <hi>Euridea,</hi> as ſhe who would have poyſon'd her; not diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembring what the meat was, ſhe onely ſenſibly found her ſelf offended, remembring alſo, that ſhe had not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied her in the eating of that diſh, although ſhe had fed on many others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were under pretence of a faſt. Her minde did not forbear to ſuggeſt ſome woman quarrels which happen'd betwixt them, although of ſlight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, yet of much force in her thoughts, which reſolv'd her to venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to enforce her ſuſpitions, her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation concurr'd in marking divers geſtures, and ſome words ſhe then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, as diſcoveries of a hidden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation; and teſtimonies of an ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected minde. Being at laſt forcibly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough confirm'd by the aſſurance of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48268:66"/>women about her, of all the effects of moſt powerful poyſon, and finding her agony continue, it rendred her belief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</p>
            <p>Being herewith enrag'd, ſhe breaks forth into exaggerations, fit to thunder out her diſdain againſt a Traitreſs, who under colour of diſguis'd friendſhip, had made her prove ſuch grievous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. That ſhe might not aggravate her grief, the agitation of the humors being not yet ſettled, ſhe was deſir'd not to diſturb her ſelf more, but quiet her offended heart, by making a victim of her treacherous enemy to her revenge. In conformity to the advice, they accuſe her of the crime to the Juſtice, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him of the fact, and ſolliciting her deſerv'd puniſhment. The cauſe being heard by the Magiſtrate, <hi>Euridea</hi> was by his order impriſoned in a dark Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there ſhe might be proceeded againſt, and receive the ſentence which the Judges ſhould decree againſt her: ſhe in vain demands the cauſe of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, in vain ſhe witneſſed her own innocency, ſince where its neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to obey the violence of ſo many, 'tis bootleſs to produce excuſes for her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48268:66"/>The fame was ſoon ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that <hi>Euridea</hi> was impriſoned for poyſoning this Lady at her table; the publick voice added that ſhe was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy condemned to death, as that lyer when it cannot offend truth, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the fact, yet at leaſt it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice it with falſe additions. <hi>Niarpe</hi> heard of this accident, more confus'dly then others; ſo that in repeating it, he even confounded it in himſelf, by reaſon of the dangers wherein his beloved ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was.</p>
            <p>This, ſays he to himſelf, is the time to terminate thy pains; here is the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a certain death, together with a moſt indearing deceit to make my faith and affection appear; let me but encounter this capital ſentence, inſteed of my Miſtris, and I ſhall make it appear that the intention was always impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in me of killing her when we lov'd, when even now, when I ought to hate her, by my own life I ſhall free her from loſing of hers. Ariſe O my heart, run boldly in this occaſion to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thy fidelity; to live is no waies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, ſince a fallacious dream alone, is able to diſturb thy contentment, even
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48268:67"/>to diſpair: Haſt thou ſuffered ſo many torments, not to yeeld to be thought an unhappy Traytor: unlooſe thy ſelf from theſe bonds, that thy ſoul may be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and happily fly away without the weight of ſuch grievous paſſions which clog it.</p>
            <p>He conſulted in this manner with his own thoughts, without being aware to what end theſe counſels directed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. He confounded himſelf in the vehemency of his deſire, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to repacifie him with his beloved, which inconſiderately precipitated him in the arms of every occaſion which his hopes repreſented favorable. He goes to <hi>Euridea</hi>'s houſe with theſe revolv'd thoughts in his ſtupified minde, to gain a perfect notice of the fact: the ſervants were aſtoniſh'd, no leſs in ſeeing, then in hearing him ſo perplex'd for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſes deliverance; they knowing of his former paſſages, eſteem'd him as a perfideous enemy. They which ſerv'd her ſaid in confirmation of the relation, which he had already heard, adding with multiplyed oathes that ſhe was innocent of the imputed crime: that they had ſeaſon'd all the meat without the leaſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48268:67"/>poyſonous ingredient, or their being any wayes offended by the taſt thereof; were the accuſation true, they doubted onely of the diſh which was ſent for a preſent, yet that excluded the fault from thoſe of the houſe, as being a recevi'd deceit. They the more provok'd him, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſudden and eminent danger of their Lady, ſince, without defence, ſhe was to maintain all what her incens'd Accuſer did inſtance; they thought they might move <hi>Niarpe</hi> out of pitty to afford her ſome aſſiſtance; although they durſt not intreat it, beleeving his diſdain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Euridea,</hi> to have been equal with what ſhe did beleeve of his cruelty; obſerving beſides, that her ſafety was urgent; they ſollicited him further, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that all remedy would be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, unleſs ſuddenly undertaken. And according to the property of women, eaſie of beleef, when mov'd by fear, they thought even that their Lady was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy brought to the Scaffold, and her head was cuting off by the Executioner.</p>
            <p>The diſtemper'd minde of the young man could no longer hold at that impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; taking the danger far greater then in truth it was; and ſo raviſht, away he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48268:68"/>runs to the Tribunal, where his love was to be condemn'd, and according to his belief unqueſtionably to be executed. Preſenting himſelf to the Judge; I am come, ſays he, to deliver the innocent from death; the poyſon which crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates <hi>Euridea,</hi> as that ſhe had prepared it for her friend, was ſent by me in the meat, which (as I perceive) was brought to her table at dinner, I ſent it to intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate <hi>Euridea</hi> her ſelf, but baffled by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I ſee my ſelf betray'd by my own deſigns: repenting to have machinated her death, I correct my error, neither will I double the crime, unjuſtly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that which now lies on her by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a falſe accuſation.</p>
            <p>What ſayeſt thou, O fooliſh <hi>Niarpe?</hi> Thou hazardeſt thy ſelf to regain the affection of thy dear, and to aboliſh the thought of being a Traytor, thou accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thy ſelf that thou wouldſt have poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned her? Doeſt thou think to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate thy ſelf by a ſiniſter belief, with this fraud of thine thou caſteſt down thy hopes, and rather confirmeſt her belief, by confeſſing to have endeavour'd to poyſon her? The more envenom'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, at this thy redoubled at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48268:68"/>inſteed of a lover, thou wilt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her a fury; thou ſhalt die infamous, hated by her, deteſted with perpetual ignominy, which will follow the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thy twice repeated treachery; a wiſe reſolution, a prudent counſel! What thou didſt deſign to ſhun, thou eſtrangeſt thy ſelf from the end which thou didſt preſcribe to thy amorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>But 'tis no wonder that he ſhould do thus who truſted a blinde guide; ſpurr'd on by love to this action, he went on without thinking what would become of the buſineſs, weaving a black mantle of guiltineſs for his own innocency; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in ſpeaking, he made his tongue the nurſe of his love, as he had before follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſteps. The Judge admits of his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary accuſation, exchanging the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer for the Lady whom he declares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and taking her out of priſon, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied her curioſity, by relating the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which was the occaſion of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd for deliverance. She at firſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the guilty perſons true heart; but afterwards underſtanding that it was <hi>Niarpe,</hi> who had confeſs'd that that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been deſign'd for her death;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48268:69"/>thoſe affections then preceding it, which will ſuffer no bridle, to wit, diſdain; ſhe exclaimes againſt his perfidiouſneſs, who the ſecond time diſcover'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of treachery againſt her life.</p>
            <p>Aſſuredly, ſaid ſhe, remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath forc'd thee for ſuch treacheries to condemn thy ſelf? O God, how can a ſoul, although perverſe, conceive a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt me, which ſeems inſatiable, even to my death? I who lov'd him with ſo ſincere a heart, anſwered him with ſuch a ready compliance, and ſo curteouſly, that (I dare ſwear) I never had but amorous deſires for him. Let Ladies learn to be free to their young Lovers, that they may gain ſo grateful a reward, even for the teſtimonies of tollerable cruelty. Beleeve not now, that if there were a man more faithful then he, that even I could procure my ſelf, to overcome the inconſtancy of my ſex, to parralel him in affection.</p>
            <p>Exaggerating after this manner her paſſion ſhe comes to the preſence of the Judge, and doubly makes <hi>Niarpe</hi> guilty, diſcovering his former attempt to kill her in her ſweeteſt reſt, in her quiet ſleep. One fault confirms another; <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridea</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48268:69"/>having aggravated his fault, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts aſſured that he ſhould be ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh'd by a mortal ſentence: ſhe gladly returns home, no leſs for her own liberty, then for her aſſured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the encounters and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate congratulations of her ſervants, ſhe was adviſed by their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with <hi>Niarpe</hi> of the information he had taken, and the reaſon of her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment: but above all of his anguiſh, and how grievouſly he took her danger. The Lady having heard, though unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, theſe expreſſions, contrary to her will, which was intoxicated with finiſter thoughts; yet ſhe began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on her thoughts, how he by his own election had exchang'd himſelf to ſuffer her danger, which did no ways confirm a perverſe intention, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant affection. She obſerv'd what was ſaid, being oblig'd to beleeve him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of any crime in this accident, which before he had had no notice of; ſhe could not judge her ſelf deſirous of his death, who had diſcovered himſelf, by what was told her, in danger for her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48268:70"/>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, this was not ſufficient to remove from her minde the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance which the firſt impreſſion made, which was rendred indelible, if her eyes did not lye, which had ſeen him with his unſheth'd ſteel arm'd againſt her breſt.</p>
            <p>The words of a Lady, with whom ſhe had many conteſts, cooperated to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a contrary belief; <hi>Niarpe</hi>'s reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being by <hi>Euridea</hi>'s fury hightned, who refus'd to hear his excuſes: being at that time to give her a viſit, from her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment bred from the confuſion of her thoughts, ſhe took occaſion to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate in her diſcourſ <hi>Niarpe</hi>'s conſtancy, fomented onely by an indiſcreet rigour, witneſſing, ſhe had ſeen him deſpair at her feet, for the loſs of her good graces, and a ſupplicant, with prayers, to regain them; ſhe forms a diſtinct Narration of all his words, his ſighs, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to undeceive the fraud of a ſimple dream, with the continued atteſtations of an exviſcerated paſſion, making the truth appear by reaſon of the accident, which that night happen'd unhappy to their loves, which ſtill had been hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obſcurity of a miſtake: ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48268:70"/>the precedent proofs of his ſingular faith, with the following teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; following it with an extreme grief of heart, as with an uninterrupted care to pacifie her anger; and then this laſt action confirm'd the immutability of his extraordinary affection, ſince he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded his own innocency and his life, to deliver her from an imaginary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Say no more, ſay no more, ſaid <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> whoſe heart was already awakn'd with the knowledge which aroſe from theſe diſcourſes, that ſhe had unjuſtly ill uſed her lover; yet ſhe perſever'd in her conteſt, the obſtinacy of her old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; till at laſt ſhe was caſt down by the teſtimony which <hi>Niarpe</hi> witneſſed, even to the hazard of his life, by a voluntary accuſation made by himſelf, to afford her the means to get out of the labyrinth of her priſon, the center whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was death. He ſaid, he had ſent the poyſon, with the meat which arriv'd at dinner time. Now whether whilſt ſhe was pondering in her minde, either of the felicities, or the deſpair of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he coms who had brought her that meat, to fetch back the diſh; from this
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48268:71"/>diſtinct information, ſhe got full notice of the fact, knowing that the preſent came from the civility of certain Nuns; (as he related it) and not corrupted by the fidelity of the meſſenger, who carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The ground of the deſign fail'd whereupon <hi>Niarpe</hi> had made himſelf guilty: The building fell which his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Fortune had built under the credit of treachery. Amongſt a thouſand trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his Lady bitterly repented hereof, for having unreaſonably puniſh'd him with ſo much fierceneſs. Doubting to be the cauſe of his death, ſhe ſaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair enterchang'd, whereto the neceſſity of her indiſcreet rigours had often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him; but being blinded by the fury of the deceit, not diſcerning his faith, ſo blinde did love make her, that ſhe was heedleſs of her own ſufferings.</p>
            <p>She returns to the Tribunal, and as carried away with doating, ſhe demands the reſtoration of her Lover, that <hi>Niar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi> ſhould be ſet at liberty; if juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a victim, ſhe alone was fit for the Executioner's hands, ſince ſhe had been ſacrilegious, having violenc'd the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Faith and Love. Thoſe who not long before had heard her enrag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48268:71"/>the ſame perſon, begging cruelty for his puniſhments, were aſtoniſhed to ſee ſuch a change; ſhe who had accuſed him of double treacheries, now with ſo much vehemency, endeavoured to cry him up as innocent: The Judge had a competent ſatisfaction for his curioſity in the relation made of the ſucceſs, which might diſcipher the enigma's of ſo unlook'd for a change. They who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired <hi>Euridea,</hi> related the whole buſineſs, who from her ſtupidity being reconcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in her ſelf, diſcovered no leſs her own confuſion in her very accent; yet from time to time ſhe replicated her inſtance for the recovery of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>They witneſſed the counterſigns gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the unvariable affection of the one, and of the innocency of the others deceiv'd belief; ſo that the cauſe was ſuſpended with the deliverance of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the Judge had more apparent motives to ſatisfie the demands of the Accuſer, who complain'd as having been poyſon'd. She was yet kept in her bed by reaſon of her weakneſs, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the violence of the accident more then the neceſſity of any ill. Skilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48268:72"/>were ſent, who by a diligent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of all what ſhe had eat that day, and weighing the effects flowing from thence which ſhe call'd poyſon, they made a punctual ſcrutiny in ſearch of the truth, and from one head to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they concluded the original of this agitation, which they did beleeve came from nothing, but the malign quality of the Muſhroms, which being not wel pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, had the force not onely to weaken, but even to have kill'd her. A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reflection having denied the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of grief or diſdain, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd them to hear, that al of the family had cryed out that ſhe had been poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, now made the ſick Lady of their opinion; ſhe perceived that all her ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were groundleſs, ſince neither in <hi>Euridea,</hi> who was accus'd, nor in <hi>Niarpe,</hi> who had made himſelf guilty, ſhe could finde any occaſion for ſuch a treachery. So that from the ſatisfaction of the one, and the ſworn teſtimony of the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, a Decree of liberty was granted to our lovers. This revolution of Fortune was unexpected by the young man, who betwixt the thoughts of death, could not promiſe himſelf the enjoyment of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48268:72"/>ſo much felicity, unleſs by being ſo neer death, he might promiſe himſelf a future beatitude. He ſaw himſelf in his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved's arms, when he thought to go to his execution, and receive amorous kiſſes from her lips, when he thought to hear the rigorous ſentence of his death. He knew not who to thank for ſuch a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, unleſs that very hour which had occaſion'd all his torments. His heart being reſtor'd into its former ſweet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, ſoftly melts it ſelf away, to make an inextinguiſhable lamp for the light of his joyes.</p>
            <p>The Scaene being thus chang'd in his belov'd, there onely appear'd repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of tenderneſs, who repented not onely her own miſtake, but alſo the torments ſhe had occaſion'd: when ſhe had reheated him, ſo that hee could no more be changed, as ſhe thought by the cold of her rigorous correſpondence, ſhe reſolv'd on an amorous peace, and invites him to negotiate it himſelf with greater advantage of his guſt, then he poſſibly could have deſired.</p>
            <p>Were we not, ſaid ſhe, ſubject to fail, we ſhould not remember our humanity; and were we not ſubject to obey our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48268:73"/>our ſouls would ſoar up too high, were they not depreſs'd by that tyranny; yet ſhall I not bluſh to confeſs my fault, for having thought you unfaithful I will with a ſincere chaſtiſement correct it if you pleaſe; I ſhall alone puniſh my ſelf, did I not think to offend your love, which I have experienc'd ſo conſtant, with my death, or with my torments. Return therefore to my houſe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your arms I may know your will either to enjoy or deſtroy me, as it ſhall be your pleaſure, with a dominion over me gain'd by the merit of your unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſtancy, you ſhall have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to follow what you ſhall think moſt agradible.</p>
            <p>Our Lover would have anſwered theſe kinde invitations, or rather loving miſtruſts; but ſhe hindred him, ſaying, It is no time nor fit place for amorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, otherwiſe ſuperfluous, when the teſtimonies of love were ſo quick, it concerns me to witneſs my gratitude, and its my obligation to exviſcerate my ſelf to correſpond with your affection; Its I ought to dye, either for the delight I ſhall take to pleaſe you, or by the exceſs of my pains in chaſtiſement of your ſo ill rewarded a deſert.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48268:73"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Niarpe</hi> held his peace at her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and his debility being reinforc'd preparing his arms to cement their joys; He goes with <hi>Euridea</hi> to her houſe, and with embraces and kiſſes the peace was concluded, before it was treated by words of mouth. They liv'd afterwards regretting onely their loſt and fled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, confirming by experience; that the Water of Diſdain ſprinkled on the Furnace of Love, reinvigorates its ardor inſteed of extinguiſhing it.</p>

            <p>IN the moſt noble City of <hi>Bologna,</hi> pretending his ſtudies, liv'd <hi>Lovanio,</hi> the Count of <hi>Roccabruna</hi>'s ſon, a youth, who with the comlines of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48268:74"/>and the affability of his manners, won the love of all thoſe who had the happineſs of his acquaintance. As he was one day going towards the walls to take the air, he was ſtopt by the voices of ſome, who crying out Fire, fire, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully begg'd help; amongſt others who deſpairing out of fear, had bedew'd her cheeks with her tears, was a Lady, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the roſes of her face were fled, yet ſhe might brag it ſtill incloſed a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of beauties; who although with the greateſt deſpight of danger, ſhe nothing loſt her courage; yet unable to remedy the buſineſs, and abandon'd of all help, was oblig'd to fear; <hi>Lovanio</hi> obſerving that no body mov'd, the neighbouring houſes being empty of inhabitants; there being ſome few poor little unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward women, who multiplying their outcries, encreas'd but the fright and confuſion. He reſolves to go himſelf with his ſervants to quench the fire; which already in triumph had rais'd it ſelf up to heaven: Entring the palace where the flames furiouſly turn'd about, after having wiſh'd <hi>Deadora,</hi> for ſo was the Lady call'd, that ſhe ſhould quiet her fears, whilſt he would endeavour to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48268:75"/>her from danger, he with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ſome others, who came at the cry, went up to the top of the houſe, and there labours ſo with his hands and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the fire was in a ſhort time bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a thick cloud of ſmoke: He ſcarce was come down, when <hi>Gelaſio</hi> the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies husband meets him, who having had notice of the danger, was come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thither. Their words were many, &amp; ful of civility, <hi>Gelaſio</hi> even offering him the houſe as Padron, ſince he had ſav'd it from the fire; <hi>Deadora</hi> came alſo to theſe thankſgivings, with ſo charming a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, that <hi>Lovanio</hi> findes his heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd with worſe fires, then thoſe he had lately quench'd. He had ſeen her at firſt with a ſenſe of pitty, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with fear, ſhe could do nothing, but weep and cry, the extinguiſh'd co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of her face had not then the power to enflame a minde. Her heart ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now reſtor'd the honors it had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from her face, and the beauty of her eyes being no more troubled with her tears, his pitty was rais'd to love; <hi>Lova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> vowing all his affection to the fair <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adora,</hi> who ſoon obſerv'd it, and the more, for that at his leave he ſent her

She was no ſooner alone but her curioſity, or perhaps even her affection ſent her looks to the reading of the note; before ſhe had made an end of it ſhe gave her ſelf for loſt: thoſe characters were too powerful againſt the weakneſs of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart, which is ſoft to all expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Being tyranniz'd by amorous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſhe found no reſt, but in her diſquiets. She brought all her affections to confult in her minde, which at laſt gave ſentence in favour of <hi>Lovanio:</hi> Whereupon being forc'd by the power
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48268:77"/>which knows not reaſon, and operates with the greater impetuoſity, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter refiſtance it ſindes, ſhe commits her thoughts to the paper, which contain'd theſe conceits.</p>

            <p>This letter being ſecretly conveyed into <hi>Lovanio</hi>'s hands, fills him with ſo much joy, that he could ſcarce contain himſelf, knowing that <hi>Deadera</hi> would not belye theſe characters, theſe repulſes being invitations, and theſe doubts aſſurances of love. Whence argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Ladies affection was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he ever hop'd, he ſo operates, that without communicating his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to paper, he gets the oportunity to ſpeak to her at a little grate, and there to concert the accompliſhment of their amorous pretenſions. <hi>Gelaſio, Deadora</hi>'s husband, was ſo given to all kinde of love, that with the Camelion, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes all the colours which comes neer it, he at ever object chang'd his love and affection. To ſatisfie the vanity of his luſt, he made no diſtinction of nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or beauty; He confeſs'd himſelf as well enchain'd with ſilver hairs, as with golden looks; and was equally tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd over by a Lady of honor, and a common Courteſan. His affection
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48268:78"/>triumphs as much over that fair one, who was without blemiſh, even from the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of envy, as over that beauty which was offended with a thouſand, and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed by an infinity of imperfections. <hi>Deadora,</hi> who knew her husbands genius, thinks on a means to enjoy her Lover: ſhe knew that her Chamber maid <hi>Aleria</hi> was ſollicited by him with promiſes, gifts, and often with threats to ſatisfy his luſtful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; whereto occurr'd that <hi>Aleria</hi> was naturally tormented with all kinde of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſires, ſo that nothing bridled her, but the fear of her miſtris: who with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> eyes watch'd <hi>Gelaſio</hi>'s immoderate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. <hi>Deadora</hi> therefore, that ſhe might accommodate her ſelf with her Lover, was content that <hi>Aleria,</hi> in the mean time, ſhould entertain her husband: which very often happily ſucceeded, the warm ſeaſon of the year concurring in favour of their loves. <hi>Gelaſio</hi> and <hi>Deadora</hi> ſlept in two ſeveral Chambers, ſo that <hi>Lovanio</hi> being let into a ground Chamber, whilſt <hi>Gelaſio</hi> enjoyed <hi>Aleria,</hi> who at the ſame time garded her miſtris, ſatisfied her maſter, and recreated her ſelf: But becauſe the felicities of love are but as flyes, which live and die in a day, Fortune with the ſame facility would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48268:79"/>thoſe ſhe had lifted up. <hi>Lovanio</hi> was one evening let in by <hi>Aleria,</hi> ſomewhat ſooner then was uſual: She after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with a thouſand careſſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes of love, which her breaſt nouriſh'd, tells him, that <hi>Deadora</hi> would be a while buſie, having not yet ended her ſupper, and that in the mean time ſhe had commiſſion to entertain him. <hi>Lovanio</hi> kindely thanks her, ſaying; That it was not the firſt of his obligations to her. <hi>Aleria</hi> ſuffered him not to proceed, but taking him by the hand, ſhe ſays, Signor <hi>Lovanio,</hi> There can be no greater infelicity, then to ſee others reap the fruits of ones pains: I have ſuffered ſo much that at laſt I might get your love, and I have gained nothing but dangers and fears. Is it poſſible, that leaſt out of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, if not out of love, I may deſerve the favour of your good Graces? Truly, I do not ſo much envy my miſtris in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your whole heart; I onely lament the miſeries of my fortune, which hath plac'd me in a condition to be deſpiſed, even by thoſe whom I continually pleaſure: which having ſaid, ſhe begins to kiſs his hand, which ſhe held faſt in her own, with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears, that <hi>Lovanio,</hi> who at firſt laught at her folly, being unable to reſiſt, gave
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48268:79"/>himſelf over to ſenſe: The more readily, becauſe the beauties of <hi>Aleria</hi> were ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that he would rather have deſerv'd the title of ſtupid, had he not taken the occaſion of enjoying her. <hi>Lovanio</hi> and <hi>Aleria</hi> were ingulf'd in the ſweets of Love, when <hi>Deadora</hi> grew impatient that ſhe was not call'd, and perhaps not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſie (ſince tis the uſury of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe that love) having ſeen her husband in bed, ſhe ſilently comes down into the ground chamber; and there having found her Lover in the amorous liſts, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with an unſpeakable impetuoſity, without conſidering the danger of her life and honour, ſhe at once furiouſly begins to move both her hands and her tongue, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Traytor, do you thus triumph over my ſhame? Is this the reward of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and of my faith; I will ſo treat you, that I ſhall rejoyce to ſee you buried in my precipice, that my ruin may not be the more funeral by your laughter or laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs. She accompanies theſe words with ſo many blowes and bitings, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria</hi> bled in ſeveral places; <hi>Lovanio,</hi> in the mean time, caſting himſelf at her feet, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of her with the ſweeteſt words, which would have introduc'd pitty, even into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48268:80"/>ſenſible ſtones. Sometimes remembring her of the danger their lives were in; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excuſing his own error, promiſing repentance; ſometimes proteſting his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had ſinned without the conſent of his heart. <hi>Deadora</hi> being deaf to his entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and humiliation, continued to injure them both in word and deed. When with a face which carried horror and terror in his eyes, <hi>Gelaſio</hi> appeared; who without ſleeping, had long heard <hi>Aleria,</hi> and riſing to ſeek her, he comes to a place where he hears, although indiſtinctly, <hi>Deadora</hi>'s rage, <hi>Aleria</hi>'s tears, and <hi>Lovanio</hi>'s requeſts. <hi>Gelaſio</hi> having taken a Dagger, furiouſly runs to the noiſe: Scarce ſees he <hi>Lovanio</hi> embracing his wives knees, but he knew him guilty of having raviſh'd the honeſty and reputation of his houſe; whereupon he runs to him, and ſtrikes him ſuch a blow on the head, that he being diſabled to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain himſelf, falls to the ground with the pangs of death, which were more terrible then ordinary, ſeeing that his ſenſuality had prepar'd a ſepulcher as well for <hi>Deadora,</hi> as for himſelf; <hi>Gelaſio</hi> obſerving <hi>Lovanio</hi> in a dying condition, unable to defend himſelf. turning to his wife with a tone of voice, which would have begot horror in a breaſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48268:80"/>of Marble, tells her; Woman, thy crime is ſo great, that to paſs by it without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, would rather be an effect of weakneſs then of mercy: yet ſince I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in my minde the characters of my firſt affection; I ſhall pardon thee; but on this condition, that this Adulterer, having thy heart, thou ſhalt herewith ſtab him in the breaſt. <hi>Deadora</hi> having taken the Dagger, with a greater undauntedneſs, then is to be found in a feminine heart, ſays; Sir, The ſins of love deſerve ſome pardon, becauſe they oftner come from deſtiny, then from eſlection, Yet I confeſs my ſelf unworthy of it, for that I could not regulate my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs. Saying theſe words, and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gning to ſtrike <hi>Lovanio,</hi> ſhe ſheathes the Dagger in her husbands boſom; who ſcarce could ſay, Curſed, woman, thus at once to rob me of my life and honor; but he loſt his ſpeech with a many lowings, as if he would rather threaten death then dye, ſo he unhappily ended his daies. <hi>Deadora</hi> having executed that endeavour, with but too much courage, and but too little juſtice; runs to fetch the laſt breath from the ſoul of <hi>Lovanio;</hi> who having violenc'd himſelf, ſaid; My dear, <hi>Deadora,</hi> I dye content, ſince I dye not unreveng'd: Pardon me,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48268:81"/>and ſuffer that the chaſtiſment of a humane error may terminate with him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it: I beg of you, that with your diſdain, you make not my aſhes unhappy. But, alas, this is the laſt period of my life: Conſolate, O my dear, the miſeries of its paſſage, with the laſt of thy kiſſes. At the end of theſe words he ceaſed to live. <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi> ſtupified with grief, was rendred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, like a Statue; after ſhe had ſaid, crying out with a deluge of tears. Stay, O the Soul of my Deareſt beloved <hi>Lova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio:</hi> Its not fit that thou ſhouldſt go to the Shades alone. Which having ſaid, ſhe ſtrikes the Dagger through her own Heart; whence her Soul ſoon iſſues with her blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aleria,</hi> who in the repreſentation of this Tragedy, had ſuffered the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a thouſand deaths, flying from the ſight and enquiry of thoſe, who in great numbers came to the noiſe: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the ſame time the light and her ſelf, retired into the uppermoſt parts of the Houſe; and there having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened a Halter, ſhe miſerably throwes away her life, giving a juſt reward to her own diſhoneſty.</p>
            <p>Hence may be comprehended, That
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48268:81"/>all the Pleaſures of unlawfull Loves fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally terminate Tragedies; and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Affections can have no other but an unhappy end.</p>

               <hi>GENUOA</hi> was the place where <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milio</hi> was born, whoſe unproſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſes, confirm the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That a mans natural Climat is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48268:82"/>moſt unhappy. He obſerv'd how the treacheries of hidden enemies plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his death, in conformity with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant deſtiny; whereupon he retires to <hi>Lucca,</hi> where his paſſions had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from his eſtrangment, from that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where that ſtar ſhone, which was the very Sun of his felicity, but the pleaſure of hunting; ſpending the greateſt part of his time amongſt thoſe Hills which ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the City; he rendred himſelf as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the wild beaſts, as he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and grateful to the Ladies and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, who in thoſe Villa's enjoy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Autumn: According to the cuſtom of Hunters, he often frequented a Coppice which extended it ſelf over a little Hill, which the thicker it was, appear'd the more delightful. He never entred it without bringing away ſtore of game. In thoſe parts there was one, who being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the delights of the ſcituation and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of the Inhabitants, whoſe name was <hi>Hippolito,</hi> being a lover of the ſport, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a ſingular friendſhip to <hi>Emilio;</hi> So that <hi>Cleria, Hippolito</hi>'s wife contracted alſo ſo great a familiarity with him, that upon all occaſions of invitation, he diſcourſed, and paſt the time with her, with ſuch ſports as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48268:83"/>the diverſity of the ſeaſon and place affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſo that <hi>Cleria</hi> and <hi>Emilio</hi> were the promoters of all paſtimes. The modeſty and civility of <hi>Emilio,</hi> although a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, made way for him to any kinde of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar converſation. He ſo ſerv'd the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that there appeared no partiality in him, more towards the one then the other; <hi>Cleria,</hi> above all, was endued by Nature with all thoſe good Graces which are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in a Lady; beſides, ſhe was ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courted by <hi>Emilio,</hi> and differently from the reſt; acknowledg'd with a particular affections not onely for her qualities, but alſo for the obligations he profeſt in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the favours he had receiv'd, and for the ſtrict friendſhip he had with her husband. <hi>Emilio,</hi> amongſt theſe delights, enjoy'd a calm life, which was afterwards troubled by Love, the occaſion of all ill, which was rais'd in <hi>Cleria</hi> towards him. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milio</hi> being given to hunting and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſports, thought thoſe demonſtrations, which upon many occaſions <hi>Cleria</hi> us'd in her diſcourſe, which her flames ſent forth, ſprightly jeſts from the familiarity of their converſation.</p>
            <p>Now it happened, that a day being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed when the Cavaliers and Ladies
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48268:83"/>were to meet at a Feaſt in a place, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſtant, whereby the Lovers had leave, modeſtly, to make the reſentments of their mindes appear.</p>
            <p>On that day's morning, the youth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in extravagant habits, and various deſires, to witneſs by thoſe colours the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their hearts. <hi>Emilio,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, diſpoyld himſelf of all which might ſeem to ſhew any partiality in his thoughts: The Company having met at <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s houſe; <hi>Cleria</hi> being full of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, began to diſcourſe now with one, and then with another, turning to <hi>Emilio,</hi> ſhe favours him with a ſmile, and ſays; It diſpleaſeth me, to ſee that your Lady ſuffers you to appear ſo poor in favours. <hi>Emilio</hi> anſwer'd, That he wanted one; but the following day he hop'd to make prize of one; and ſhewing the manner how he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to purſue his deſign, he ſhews her the gun he had one his ſhoulder. Then ſays <hi>Cleria,</hi> you would have a dead Lady. To whom <hi>Emilio</hi> replies, That he followed his deer, but to caſt her down: <hi>Cleria</hi> adds, That ſince he had ſuch thoughts; there was no Lady but would be proud of his ſervice. I know very well, replies <hi>Emilio,</hi> That a Lady hath no greater pleaſure, then to fall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48268:84"/>before thoſe who deſire her, and though ſhe flees, ſhe deſires to be taken and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. I ſays <hi>Cleria,</hi> but by other means. For me, replies <hi>Emilio,</hi> at this time I know no other more proportionable means, then this for to compaſs my ends. At this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Hippolito,</hi> jeſtingly, ſays, Signor <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> I ſhall reſign you my wife for your Lady, aſſuring me that you will willingly quit me of the trouble; <hi>Cleria</hi> turning to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a diſdainful ſmile, ſays; I thank you with ſo good a heart, that perhaps you may repent it. They fell upon other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, till they all took their way towards the appointed place: <hi>Emilio</hi> walk'd along with <hi>Cleria,</hi> and led her by the hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing by this oportunity, ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes, whereto <hi>Cleria</hi> alwayes conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That ſhe indeed was his Miſtris. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> hath given me to you, now it belongs to you to caſt me down, but beleeve me, I will not dye alone; and at laſt, ſhe ſaid, ſhe reſolv'd to live hereafter, but only in and for him. Theſe diſcourſes aſſur'd <hi>Emilio</hi> of <hi>Cleria</hi>'s heart, to his great diſpleaſure; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch, as her husbands friendſhip permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him not ſo maliciouſly to offend him in his reputation. He anſwered her with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, ſeeming not to underſtand the end
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48268:84"/>ſhe aim'd at. The day paſt with infinite ſolace; <hi>Emilio</hi> was onely troubled, that he could not correſpond with the Love of <hi>Cleria,</hi> whoſe beauty forc'd all hearts to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore her. After a few daies, winter draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer, <hi>Hippolito</hi> retreats to the Town to the great grief of <hi>Cleria,</hi> who thereby was deprived of the opportunity, ſo frequently and familiarly to commerce with her Dear. Before her departure ſhe importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately exacted from him promiſes, with oathes, whereby ſhe oblig'd him every day to let her ſee him in that ſtreet, where ſhe liv'd, that at leaſt ſhe might be conſolated with the ſight of him. <hi>Emilio</hi> inviolably obſerves his promiſe, and thence forward, about the ſhutting up of the evening, his ordinary walk was by <hi>Cleria</hi>'s window, who conſtantly expected him, giving him mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied ſigns of Love; which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by many (neither can it happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in what publick place ſoever) rais'd the general opinion: That although very ſecretly, yet <hi>Emilio</hi> and <hi>Cleria</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Lovers.</p>
            <p>There liv'd in <hi>Lucca,</hi> baniſh'd from his Country, <hi>Millan,</hi> one call'd <hi>Diego,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Spaniſh blood, who having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the mutual looks which paſt betwixt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48268:85"/>
               <hi>Cleria</hi> and <hi>Emilio,</hi> and concluding, that they ſecretly enjoy'd the fruits of Love, he reſolv'd to tempt his fortune with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And giving way to ſuch thoughts, flyes out in words; ſaying; that he even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo would enjoy her, ſince ſhe felicitated <hi>Emilio</hi> with an amorous correſpondence. A Cavalier hears theſe words, and anſwers him: You have a very baſe eſteem of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milio;</hi> I know that he is not of ſuch a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, that he will either ſuffer a rival in love, or abandon the Lady. If he forſakes not his beloved, anſwers <hi>Diego,</hi> he muſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his life. This his arrogancy diſpleas'd the Gentleman, ſo that he could not at leaſt, but diſcover it to his friend, who, burning with diſdain, was reſolv'd to make tryal of his pride. He prays his friend that he might do it alone; and preſently going towards <hi>Cleria</hi>'s ſtreet. He went not far, but <hi>Diego</hi> comes thither; <hi>Emilio</hi> orders it ſo, that he meets him under the window where <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was; and with a loud voice, ſays, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Diego,</hi> this is the place where one of us muſt leave his life, or his Lady, and his hand accompanying his tongue, he at the ſame time draws his ſword. <hi>Diego</hi> does the like, who although he behaved himſelf gallantly, yet he remains mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48268:85"/>and his death had ſuddenly followed, had not <hi>Cleria</hi> with her crying out, oblig'd <hi>Emilio</hi> to retire: <hi>Diego</hi> was carried home, and knowing that himſelf had been the cauſe of his miſchance, was eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; ſo that their peace was ſoon made. The ſucceſs was divul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was noiſed about the Town, ſtruck <hi>Emilio</hi> to the heart, ſince it covered her with ſhame, who was the ſoul of his ſoul, and that himſelf was accuſed, as having broken his faith with his friend <hi>Hippolito.</hi> He was afflicted ſo that he gave all up to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and thought on nothing, but to finde out a way to undeceive the people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Lady her honor, and reſtore his own reputation. Being thus agitated in a Sea of trouble, he continued his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med walk through <hi>Cleria</hi>'s ſtreet, to ſhew that he had not yeilded to <hi>Diego.</hi> Fortune had oblig'd <hi>Leonello,</hi> a Neapolitan Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to love <hi>Silvia,</hi> by way of marriage, who liv'd juſt over againſt <hi>Cleria</hi>'s houſe; He began to frequent that ſtreet, which ſuggeſted to <hi>Emilio</hi>'s minde, that he might take this occaſion to aboliſh the ſuſpition
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48268:86"/>of thoſe who perſwaded themſelves, that he for love of <hi>Cleria</hi> had fought with <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> He hereupon reſolves to quarrel with <hi>Leonello,</hi> and brings his intention to paſs at ſuch a time when <hi>Hippolito</hi> was looking out of the Window: and ſtopping him there; <hi>Emilio</hi> ſays to the other, with a lofty voice: That if he valued his own life, he ſhould voluntarily baniſh himſeelf from that ſtreet; nor any longer pretend to <hi>Silvia: Leonello,</hi> although a youth, encouraged by the preſence of his Lady, who then lookt on him, made ready to anſwer him with his ſword, and boldly defends himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Emilio:</hi> Yet he remains wounded, the other being a perfect good ſword man, and at that time ſeconded with his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fury, reduc'd <hi>Leonello</hi> to beg his life of him, who as he was retiring wraps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own cloak and falls. <hi>Emilio</hi> gets him up and leads him to his houſe, where, by the interceſſion of friends, they were ſoon pacified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who had ſeen all, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, and divulging the ſequel about the City, firmly concluding, that both diſputes had been for the love of <hi>Silvia;</hi> neither was there any who now doubted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; foraſmuch, as in both the written
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48268:86"/>agreements, which were already publiſhed in <hi>Lucca, Emilio</hi> had alwaies declared, how he drew his ſword, out of his jealouſie, for <hi>Silvia. Hippolito</hi> had no ſooner thought himſelf an Acteon, but he had ſhun'd the company of the Hunter, and fled from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milio,</hi> as a Buck from a Hound; ſpeaking ill of him, and covertly threatning revenge. <hi>Emilio</hi> ſlighting his diſdain, began to think, ſince he was free from the laws of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how he might purſue his loves with <hi>Cleria,</hi> being continually ſenſible of the flames her beauty had cauſed, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd all his thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolito,</hi> on the other ſide, repenting his paſt ſuſpitions, every hour condemning his folly, for having yeelded to ſo ſalfe a belief; he reſolves to bring his wife to Town again; who had notice of all what had paſt in <hi>Lucca;</hi> whereupon ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſo great a hatred againſt <hi>Emilio,</hi> that her deſires machinated nothing but his ruin, as abſolutely beleeving <hi>Emilio</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amor'd of <hi>Silvia; Hippolito</hi> endeavours to reconcile their former friendſhip, refus'd by the other, who now aſpir'd to be of his kindred. <hi>Emilio</hi> continued to paſs before <hi>Cleria</hi>'s houſe, faigning alwaies to court <hi>Silvia,</hi> who giving credit to the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48268:87"/>with an amorous coreſpondence favour'd the demonſtrations of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as far as the termes and limits of civility permitted her. <hi>Hippolito</hi> at laſt thought on all thoſe means which might be fit to procure <hi>Emilio</hi> to be again friendly with him, and to that end, commands his wife to do the beſt offices ſhe could poſſibly in his favour towards <hi>Silvia.</hi> It being Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vale time, he appoints a ball to be danc'd in his own houſe, whereto he alſo invites <hi>Silvia,</hi> hoping that the love of her, would likewiſe bring thither <hi>Emilio</hi> So it was, taking the opportunity of diſguiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a masking habit, he embraceth the party and comes: He was known by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,</hi> who orders <hi>Cleria,</hi> who was mask'd, to ſpeak to him of <hi>Silvia,</hi> offering her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, kindly forcing him to enter into a certain chamber to drink, impoſing on her, beſides, that ſhe would not ſuffer him to depart before ſhe had pacified him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd them as they were before, familiar friends. <hi>Cleria</hi> quickly executes her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands commands, and going out of the Feaſtival Room, invites <hi>Emilio</hi> to dance, and danceth with him after the cuſtom of <hi>Lucca.</hi> She begins to diſcourſe with him, and asks him of his Miſtris; <hi>Emilio</hi> foons
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48268:87"/>diſcovers her, and with a languiſhing ſigh anſwered her, That from her alone, he could hear the moſt deſirable news. They both preſt on the others hands, ſpeaking ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their ſighs, then with their words. The Ball being ended, <hi>Cleria</hi> goes out, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Emilio</hi> by the hand, and brings him into a Chamber joyning to the Hall, under pretence, that who ſhe had with her would unmasked themſelves to drink, but would not be known, and therefore ſends away the ſervant, who kept it. The door being ſhut, and ſhe alone with <hi>Emilio,</hi> preſently takes off the vizard from both their faces. Then ſhe draws out a Dagger, and tels him; To vindicate the injuries of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs, Traytor, I ſhould ſheath this in thy heart, but that I know one death is not ſufficient to revenge the outrages thou haſt done me. At theſe words <hi>Emilio</hi> kneeling down opens his naked breſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Satisfie then, O my deareſt, thy deſires, although I have erred in nothing, but in loving thee too much. Thou lyeſt, ſays ſhe; Thou haſt to my ſhame and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight lov'd <hi>Silvia.</hi> Kill me then, replies <hi>Emilio,</hi> that in thoſe characters engraven in my heart, you may have a ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that I alwaies adored none but you.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48268:88"/>Would you have me then kill you, replies <hi>Cleria?</hi> ſo I reſolve; ariſe, and come with me, for even now I will deliciate my ſelf in thy death; which having ſaid, ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the door of another little Chamber, wherein there was a bed, and there knitting her armes about his neck, ſhe unlooſed them not, till ſhe breath'd her ſoul into him. <hi>Hippolito</hi> expecting to know to what end his wife had brought her undertakings, thought well of her ſtay: and with this hope he went merrily and boldly about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that his deſires would be felicitated by his reconciliation with <hi>Emilio.</hi> The good man knew not that his Aſcendant was then entring into <hi>Cupricorn</hi> by means of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. Cleria</hi> and <hi>Emilio</hi> at laſt retir'd to the dancing Room, diverting the toylſom paſtimes of the others, in compariſon of the private dance they had had. He dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with <hi>Silvia,</hi> whilſt retiring aſide, ſhe ſets her ſelf down. None obſerv'd <hi>Emilio</hi>'s return, but <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who being curious to know what had been done, quickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſts his wife, enquiring of the ſucceſs: She remits the relation to a fitter time; tells him onely, That if another night ſhe might repeat the endeavours ſhe had made on <hi>Emilio</hi>'s ſtubbornneſs, ſhe was confident
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48268:88"/>ſhe ſhould gain him. He was pleas'd at the motion of another feaſt for the following night, the better to effect the buſineſs which was advanc'd, being already diſpoſed. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi> gladly appoints it, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they renew the invitation. All ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding according to what had been orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the precedent night. <hi>Cleria</hi> invites <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milio</hi> into the Chamber, which was the Theater of their delights. But before them, <hi>Hippolito,</hi> to ſecure himſelf how his wife managed the buſineſs, retir'd ſecretly into the little Chamber, hiding himſelf under the bed. Without any ſuſpition, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhut the door, and on the Down they ſolace themſelves, with the ſweeteſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their loves. <hi>Hippolito</hi> being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at ſo unexpected a ſucceſs, durſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſcarce breath; He was diſarm'd, and on the otherſide, ſaw <hi>Emilio</hi> well provided with Piſtols; ſo that he thought, if he ſhould diſcover himſelf he ſhould certainly expoſe himſelf to death: What his ſenſe was in ſo rude a neceſſity, to be a witneſs of the ſports and pleaſures of the Lovers, let him imagine, who can beleeve that he was not confounded with various paſſions. At laſt the amorous wraſtlers being weary, aband on'd the Field, and going out of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48268:89"/>Room, they heard I know not what ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling under the bed. <hi>Cleria</hi> being curious to know what it was, findes that it was her husband who was there; then ſhe cries out, Alas, O <hi>Emilio,</hi> we are loſt; The Lover mov'd at theſe words, and animated at the accident grew bold, and with his Piſtol in his hand, he commands <hi>Hippolito</hi> to come forth, who, being afraid, would not raiſe his knees from the ground, before he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd they would not take away his life, which he ſubmiſſively begg'd from <hi>Emilio.</hi> He freely offered, both to him and to his wife, pardon for the injuries they had done his reputation. <hi>Cleria</hi> obſerving her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands cowardlineſs, took heart, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth her interceſſions to divert the other, who alwaies ſhewed himſelf unreſolv'd in the thought of killing him: he faigns to yeeld to her prayers; and depoſing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, he accepts the oblation of <hi>Cleria</hi>'s pardon, praiſing <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s prudence, for that reſolution; ſhewing, that ſuch like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are the more compatible; foraſmuch, as there are commonly but few women, who inviolably obſerve the faith they ow their husbands. He ſaid that ſilence and careleſneſs were forms fit in ſuch matters, that a man need not be oblig'd to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48268:89"/>diſquieted with his arms in his hand, that in this preſent exigent all ſhould ſleep in perpetual oblivion; that even him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he had judg'd this occaſion as a dream, ſo he ſhould put it out of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. He promiſed that he would never commit the like with his wife; which ſhe for her part alſo authenticates, aſſuring him, that ſhe intended ever hereafter to live according to the laws of honor. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he proteſts with threats, that if for this occaſion he ſhould ever diſguſt <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> with the leaſt ſign of remembring this eſcape, he would reſerve to himſelf a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble revenge. The other promiſeth what was requir'd of him, with the greateſt Oathes and Aſſurances that his Minde could think; Obliging himſelf never more to trouble his thoughts with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof.</p>
            <p>With the trueſt Acts of a ſincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Agreement was made, of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Union: Neither was the peace ever broken; neither did they fail in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. <hi>Hippolito</hi> was oblig'd by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral baſeneſs of his minde, and the fear he conceiv'd from the Lovers threatnings; <hi>Cleria</hi> being warned by this danger, was perſwaded to keep her replicated faith,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48268:90"/>knowing that it is alwaies dangerous to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate it. And <hi>Emilio</hi> returning to his own Country, oppos'd abſence to Love, whoſe Laws otherwiſe, perhaps, would have forced him to deſpiſe all other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations.</p>

            <p>WOMEN have not alwaies, as ſom would perſwade, bin unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their Husbands; many examples are read of their imprudence, and very many may be related, which ſerve for Rules of Chaſtity; one among others which comes in my minde to diſcourſe, certainly, may be numbred amongſt the moſt laudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48268:91"/>worthy to be recommended to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>In that City which after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi> was built by <hi>Antenore,</hi> on the moſt famous River of <hi>Brent,</hi> after that <hi>Limiſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> and <hi>Euſebio</hi> had lov'd with a ſingular correſpondence of affection; They attain'd from the curteous favour of the Stars, and from the concordant will of their parents the deſired end of their Loves: Being both bound together in the bonds of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, their affectionate union was not diminiſh'd, but ſo powerfully day by day increaſed, that they were ſingularly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all good husbands, and by all kinde wives, but paralell'd by none; although many at that time, by their example, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd themſelves to illuſtrate their marriage, with an acceſs of affection. But Heaven is not alwaies Serene; neither do Rivers alwaies run with pure water. The beauty of <hi>Limiſinda</hi> was of ſuch a temper, that it made even ſuch as Senocrates know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be men, although without orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments borrowed from Art, although ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen, although look'd upon with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity by thoſe eyes which beheld them, and deſired by all hearts, innocently murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous they bound to themſelves, amongſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48268:91"/>others, the good will of <hi>Gelindo;</hi> a youth to be reſpected amongſt the firſt of his Country, both for the Nobility of his Blood, and for the Gentility of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He ſo fiercely lov'd the Lady, that he gave himſelf over to purſue her, with all manner of ſerviceable diligence. After a long ſucceſſion of time, <hi>Limiſinda</hi> was at laſt aware of the importunate ſollicitation, wherewith her new Lover purſued her; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, either ſhe would not ſee, or car'd not for him, but ſo deſpis'd him, that the miſerable man, by reaſon of her honeſt behaviour, was often falling through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair into an exceſs of phrenſy; he tempts by the force of prayers and preſents, to poſſeſs himſelf of her ſervants, that at leaſt he might procure them to preſent her with his ſervice, or his letters; but none of them (knowing the Ladies diſpoſition) durſt take the boldneſs to offer it, being confident to incur onely ſhame, and perhaps danger. The poor young Gentleman knew not what to do; he did his beſt to free himſelf from thoſe chaines; but all his endeavours were vain; Many many months were paſt, yet in vain, he could not diſpence with his love, having not, as yet, receiv'd the leaſt ſign, upon which he might ground the leaſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48268:92"/>hope, at any time of being lov'd again. Being agitated with all, and the greateſt furies which can overwhelm the minde of a deſperate Lover, The miſerable man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thought even to bereave himſelf of his own life, that withal he might free himſelf from his torments. In theſe perturbations of minde he grew ſo weak, that every man thought he was even at deaths door, and that with his loves he would ceaſe to live. He had not, although he had a long time been a lover of <hi>Limiſinda,</hi> diſcover'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſecret of his heart: but ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reduc'd to ſuch a condition, that he had no more hope of ſafety, he reſolv'd to deſpoſit it in the boſom of a friend of his, whom, before others, from his childhood he had ſingularly preferr'd. To him he diſcover'd what had been ſo long time hid in his breſt, and in his words fell even to theſe expreſſions, that his ill was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from no other cauſe, but from his love, and that he could attribute his death to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the cruelty of <hi>Limiſinda,</hi> thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded with paſſion, did he wrongfully cal the Ladies chaſtity, cruelty: not knowing that a man cannot dye unleſs at the fatality of the determin'd time, he ſhould beleeve that his death was caus'd by the beauty of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48268:92"/>a womans face. His friend, who cordially lov'd him, and who would not have ſpared his own life to preſerve <hi>Gelindo</hi>'s, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him, that he had not before diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd this ſecret to him; comforts him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him to expect the health of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if he did but intend his cure, and ſo finde a certain remedy for the ſickneſs of his minde. Our Lover having receiv'd ſome eaſe from his friends words, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that ſome time or other he would tell him ſome eaſie and ſecure way to gain the end of his deſires; he with patience receiv'd the application of remedies for his diſeaſe, and after a few daies (although his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity paſt) ſlowly, yet he found himſelf freed of his indiſpoſition, and ſcarce had he recover'd but a part of his ſtrength, when he had recourſe to his friend, that the hopes which from him he had conceived in his minde might not be defrauded, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to teach him the eaſieſt way he could deviſe, whereby he might enjoy his <hi>Limiſinda.</hi> His friend, who knew the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vertue to be ſuch, that it admitted of no paralel, and diſcovering in <hi>Gelindo</hi> an exceſs which might rather be call'd a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fury, than an amorous affection, with a free diſcourſe ſeeks to reclaim him; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48268:93"/>him, that in following the vanity of his Cappricio's, or rather in perſecuting the praiſe worthy conſtancy of <hi>Limiſinda,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf like a mad man, who would plough the Sea, and catch the Winde in a Net; and finally, after a long diſcourſe, concludes, That if he would not retire from his undertaking ſome ill accident would certainly befal him; That the Lady would either reſolve to put him from his importunity, either accuſing of him to her husband, or making it known to her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who aſſuredly would not let paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd ſo fooliſh a temerity, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtain, with notes of infamy, the honeſt reputation of another mans Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: Love admits of no adviſe; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the truth of reaſon in his friends words, but it being not poſſeſt by him, the words were but caſt into the air; &amp; with this anſwer, onely, leaves he him. You ſhall ſoon ſee, ſaith he, whether I, or who elſe it is that ſhall be loſt. His friend was aſtoniſhed and afflicted, that he could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing move him from avoiding thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which threatned him if he ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately purſue his intentions. Many daies were not paſt, when <hi>Euſebio</hi> going to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la of his, was ſhot in the flank with a brace
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48268:93"/>of bullets, he knew not from whence; and having enmity with no man, he could not imagine from whom it ſhould come. This hurt made him fall to the ground from his horſe, ſo that he could not help himſelf, til ſome Country men paſſing by, who knew him, put him on their Cart, which was loaded with Corn, going for the City, and brought him home to his wife, who for the diſaſter which had befaln him, was unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably afflicted. The Phyſitians and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians were ſent for, who knowing the wound to be mortal, gave him over; yet they did not forbear to apply the beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they knew, which were but all in vain; the miſerable man, at the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, was forc'd to leave his life and his wife; I ſhould ſay his wife firſt, ſince by him ſhe was preferr'd before it. What ſighs and complaints ſhe made; how ſhe toar with her white hands her golden locks, and beat her candent breſt, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt; the exceſs of them was ſo great, that men would hardly find faith to beleeve the truth of them. The laſt day of the month was ſcarce at an end, the fair having perform'd the obſequies of her deceaſed Husband, when <hi>Gelindo</hi> was obſerv'd, more then he was wont, frequently to go about
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48268:94"/>the Ladies houſe, and with words and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures to diſcover himſelf more enflam'd then ever with her unparalell'd beauty. He often tempts by means of a neighbour of hers, that ſhe might procure her for him to wife; cauſing her in his name to make as generous offers, as could be made from a heart which loves immoderately. But all vainly ſucceeds, for ſhe was reſolv'd never to conſent to any: the rather, for that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe was not aſſured, yet ſhe very much doubted, that her husbands death had been effected by none, but by <hi>Gelindo;</hi> ſo that ſhe did not onely deny to exchange love, but ſhe return'd him one of the fierceſt hatreds that ever woman bore a man. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as well in hatred, as in love, have no bridle but have both in exceſs. The moſt beautiful Widow nouriſhing the fire of this diſdain within her heart, againſt <hi>Gelindo</hi> who ador'd her, often meditates to revenge her wrong'd and murther'd husband: and becauſe ſhe could finde out no way more ſecure, then one, which was to execute it with her own hands, ſhe deliberates with her ſelf, to diſpatch it after this manner. It was about the end of the year of her mourning widowhood; when on a day ſhe cals one of the moſt faithful amongſt her maids,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48268:94"/>and having ſhut themſelves up together in a ſecret Chamber, ſhe ſpeaks to her after this manner. <hi>Foſca,</hi> for ſo was her name, My long experience of thy fidelity towards my perſon aſſures me that I may confide in thee, even one of the higheſt reſolutions which I ever made in the whole courſe of my life: but before I diſcover it, think well upon it, whether you can be ſure to keep it ſecret, for if you finde that you have not reſolution enough to ſilence it, tell me that I may not ſpeak it, and I ſhall take another expedient for to accompliſh my thought. Its needleſs to relate what <hi>Foſca</hi> anſwer'd, its enough that her words were ſuch; that <hi>Limiſinda</hi> purſued her already began diſcourſe. I have alwaies heard ſay, that its impoſſible for a young woman thats handſom, and that hath taſted the delights of her husbands embraces, to live long after his death without the company of a man; I have prov'd the truth thereof from the affections of my minde: I have endeavoured a long time ſince the death of my dear <hi>Euſebio</hi> (who is now amongſt the Stars) to violence my ſelf, and to repreſs the heat of youth, which a freſh fomented my deſires of thoſe amorous pleaſures: but becauſe I perceive it impoſſible any longer
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48268:95"/>to overcome the force thereof, I have taken a reſolution, that I will not live altogether the reſt of my life, unaccompanied of a man: Its true, I would not ſubject my ſelf to that Nooſe which is not to be unlooſed betwixt man and woman, unleſs by the death of the one or other of them: Other thoughts, &amp; other deſires poſſeſs my mind. The Maid remain'd a while ſuſpended at theſe words of her Miſtris, who obſerving it, continued, Wonder not, my <hi>Foſca,</hi> at what I am to tell thee, and if you ſee me chang'd in my opinion, which in the eſteem of all was of an unparalell'd honeſty, I muſt hereafter live otherwiſe.

            <p>He was aſtoniſh'd at the reading of this Letter, and gave Love and Fortune thanks, that they had ſhew'd themſelvs ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards him: Retiring himſelf full of thoughts to the others dwelling, expecting with impatience, &amp; grievouſly ſighing after that midnight, which was to be the laſt of his life. The hour came, and he departs, and alone goes to <hi>Limiſinda</hi>'s houſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the door, which was half open, he findes <hi>Foſca,</hi> who with a ſmall light in a little Lantern, ſtood there expecting him. He enters, and is preſently led into the Chamber, which he fancied ſhould be the Theater of his Pleaſures, but prov'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that of his Tragedy. O how ill doth a man oppoſe himſelf to what muſt happen! Alas, with what blinde ſteps Love guides us to precipices.</p>
            <p>The Maid leaves him in the Chamber
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48268:97"/>with ſome Candles lighted, and goes up Stairs to give notice to her Miſtris. She having taken ſome Comfits, and ſome coſtly Wines, though ſleepy; ſends back the Maid, telling her; Bid <hi>Gelindo,</hi> from me, refreſh himſelf with theſe Junkets, the better to prepare himſelf for thoſe delights, and then come back and I will preſently come to him. <hi>Foſca</hi> goes, and returns. The loveſick <hi>Gelindo,</hi> forc'd himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though againſt his will, to taſt a part of them, and having taken a cup of Wine, he ſends it down his breſt, ſending to his heart the advertiſement of his own death. He had ſcarce drunk, but he findes his eyes out of meaſure poſſeſt with a heavy ſleep. He ſits himſelf down on a Chair, and ſcarce was ſetled, but he falls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly aſleep.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Limiſinda</hi> imagin'd that the Poyſon began to work, ſhe comes down Stairs, and enters the Room where <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindo</hi> was aſleep. The young Lady was in a confuſion, and almoſt repented that ſhe had before taken ſuch a reſolution: Nevertheleſs taking up her Heart with a Courage, and although ſhe had hid a Dagger in a Corner of the Chamber, yet would ſhe not take it; but takes
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48268:97"/>from the young man that which he wore by his ſide, and ſtriking it often through his throat, he not ſtirring at all, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then ſtreching out his laſt with his Legs and his Arms.</p>
            <p>Thus dyed this unhappy man; and thus ſhe ſacrificed his Soul to the Soul of her dead Husband.

And had follwed it with other words, had not <hi>Limiſinda</hi> cryed out, and threatned to call out for the Neighbourhood, rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the crime on her.

            <p>IN <hi>Padua,</hi> a City the more noble, by how much the more ancient, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of beauty was to be ſeen in the likeneſs of a moſt graceful Lady, who might have boaſted to have debauched the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48268:99"/>graces from <hi>Venus,</hi> to get a glorious train for her ſelf: Whenſoever ſhe made ſhew of her ſelf to the eies of others, 'twas neceſſary to beleeve, that heaven keeping open Court did abundantly diſperſe its ſplendors. Who with a chance look could ſteal away pledges of Love, ſhe had a perpetual light in her minde, which rallied up in the thoughts of all the hight of the greateſt beauties which poſſibly could be admired in a created ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Glances need not be repeated in that face, which lightning with Majeſty, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the errors of a timerous boldneſs to correct themſelves with modeſty. Sitting ſometimes at a window, ſhe ſent abroad Love her ſon to hunt after hearts, born from her eyes, and bred in the cradle of her lips, and raigning in the throne of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. There were bound with the chains of her looks the ſouls of a thouſand Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: With an extraordinary violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neer the ſun, every one was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either to have the tenderneſs of his heart melted, or burnt with the bait of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. In fine, the rayes of Divinity could finde no fitter ſphere, then that moſt beautiful face, when it would make it ſelf viſible to mortal eyes. It was once gaz'd on by two Cavaliers, born in <hi>France,</hi> but
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48268:99"/>following their ſtudies, inhabitants of that City.</p>
            <p>The conjunction of their minds had una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly led them out of their Native Kingdom, and indiſſolvably link'd them together with the tye of a ſingular friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; inviolably obſerving the laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they never ſuffered their alwaies regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted affections to diſturb their mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. They were unanimous in their apparel and diet, inſeperable in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and indiviſable in love; ſo that they it ſeem'd agree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> together to loſe their liberties, the ſoul willingly following the looks, fled away to impriſon it ſelf (if we may call Heaven a priſon) in the boſom of ſo eminent a beauty. They unanimouſly Courted the Idol, who on the Altar of her Window, receiv'd the victims of their hearts: they ſometimes fix'd their eyes on one another; I know not whether to move a mutual pitty towards eithers ardors, and to teſtifie the exceſs of that beauty, which ſilencing the tongue, rendred the eyes talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative: yet was it ſuperfluous for the eyes to ſpeake the language of admiration, ſince all the viſible ſpecies which that face repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were as many Characters, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcrib'd the neceſſity of aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48268:100"/>
            <p>It was needleſs alſo for them to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate alternatively the kindled flames of their inward affections; ſince either of them had in him a living fire, wherein the moſt vital ſpirits of the minde were couſumed. But perhaps thoſe looks were with more truth to be call'd effects of the already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd jealouſie of their hearts, for thoſe beloved beauties, ſo that they would ſpy one the others counterſigns paralel with their own, whereby they might conjecture the others love.</p>
            <p>The winde of a concordant ſigh at laſt blowes away the aſhes which hid the fire of love; whereupon not to belye the truth, they both confeſt themſelves to be Lovers. A remedy for ills, which might have been bred with the diſcontent of their wills, in conſideration of their ancient friendſhip, which ought not to ſuffer prejudice by this improvident fury, rather then affection; both of them did glory to yeild this object to the other, which the more eſtimable it ſhew'd it ſelf, it ſo much the more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated the exceſs of their faith, whereby they correſponded with a voluntary priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to felicitate his friend with the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; with the touches of a gentle affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they mutually conſecrated to eithers
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48268:100"/>contentment; the enjoyment of that beauty, which although it was the life of their hearts, was willingly renounc'd by them, whoſe mindes were the will and pleaſure of his friends; this ſtrife laſted long, till by an abſolute proteſtation they both denyed themſelves to be Lovers.</p>
            <p>The like conteſt at the ſame time hapned with the beloved Lady &amp; a neighbour and friend of hers, who by accident was there at the ſame time when the two Cavaliers were looking on them. The beauties of her face were not deſpicable, but worthy of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick eſteem, had they not been prejudic'd by the vicinity of thoſe which exceeded in beauty, even the ordinary power of Nature. They both obſerved the Cavaliers looks, wherein they ſaw the ſparks of Loves fire, which cannot be hid when they tranſmit flames from the heart to the eies. They were both alſo onely pleas'd with <hi>Irlando,</hi> who was inferiour in age, though ſuperiour in that deſert, which by youth and beauty prevailes with Ladies. In the courſe of their praiſes, they diſcover'd either of them unawares their inward affections the more freely, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as yet not known the knot of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhip: but they were no ſooner advis'd of the conſent of their thoughts, which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48268:101"/>harmoniouſly agreed to the love of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beauty, but they oblig'd themſelves to repentance, leaſt they ſhould go too far in their diſcourſe. <hi>Emilia</hi> moſt of all, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a treacherous prejudice to her practiſes, being inferiour to the other in beauty, thought to diſſemble the inclination of her minde, abſolutely denying to love <hi>Irlando,</hi> to retreeve the error ſhe had before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the liberty of her diſcourſe; yet within her ſelf ſhe reſolves to outgo her with exceſs of favours, &amp; forerun the others endeavours, who preſum'd the victory from the exceſs of her beauty. After ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, ſhe taking leave, ſeeks to confound the remembrance of Love; yet with a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous dilligence by counterſigns, ſhe ſends to enquire that Cavalier's lodging, and writes him a letter to this purpoſe.</p>

            <p>Both theſe Letters come to <hi>Roſalia</hi>'s hands almoſt at the ſame time, when thoſe of their Meſſengers were delivered <hi>Irlando</hi> from the two Ladies. The ſoul of this Cavalier ran with its moſt vital ſpirits, to honor with gratitude that of his beloved. In the tenderneſs of his higheſt Jubily the affections extended themſelves, that they might the more actively riſe to the Sphere of ſo much contentment, and to ſhun the neceſſity of being carried away by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſo great a joy. Finding himſelf gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with a correſpondence which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, he thought he might preſage, that his love would moſt happily ſucceed, when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ran before the very flight of his deſires, 'Twas fit for him to moderate the effects of ſo much ſweetneſs in reading <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe civility rather invited, then enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that heart which rejoyc'd onely in its effects, for the beauty of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armando</hi> comes in when his eyes and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48268:105"/>his minde were attentively examining thoſe Characters; to whom, ſmiling, he ſhews the Letter, diſcovering thoſe heedleſs loves; but hides <hi>Roſalia</hi>'s, eſteeming, that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence without judgment, might ruin the intereſt of his felicity. When Love will be alone, all his lawes are contrary to thoſe precepts which converſation or friendſhip hath eſtabliſhed. The remembrance of Love raiſeth ſuſpitions, original even in him from his own knowledge, they having unanimouſly ador'd that Lady. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had had no occaſion to doubt rivality, yet he might fear leaſt he might fail of ſuch a beauty, who was ſo apt to afford favours and love: So that in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of <hi>Emilia,</hi> he ſhew'd himſelf, even in his memory far from thinking on the other, naming her onely when it was neceſſary to circumſcribe this compariſon of hers. The Gentleman, who thought this occaſion fit to felicitate his thoughts, us'd all the efficacy poſſible to perſwade his his friend not to refuſe the favors of ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Lady; which if he could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd him to, he pretended that it would be free for him to ſeek <hi>Roſalia</hi>'s love.</p>
            <p>Extending his diſcourſe in her praiſe, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating her ſingular merit to ſhew him
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48268:106"/>how unjuſt the refuſal of his affection would be. He tells him, that the fairer a woman is, ſhe is ſo much the prouder, and leſs tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable then another, who being inferiour in beauty, would be wanting as much of pride, which uſually checks the delights of love. In a fair woman, quarrels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts were ordinary, foraſmuch as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power her looks have over hearts, ſhe alwaies pretends ſuch an Empire over her Lovers, that it often deſerves the title of Tiranny. He added, that it was the common courſe of Nature, that where beauty was wanting, ſhe ſupplied it with abundance of graces, which give the beſt reliſhes to amorous delights. At laſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; That when we aſpire to the higheſt pitch of proſperity in love, a man never ought to make choice of a Lady of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive beauty. It being ſufficient, ſo ſhe be not deform'd to that heart which ſeeks true and continued enjoyments: In obliging them by the intereſt of higher contents, a man might perhaps preſume to make the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of that duty inevitable, whereby he was bound not to refuſe the invitation of ſo much civility. And in fine, That his perſwaſions were not ill grounded: That as <hi>Emilia</hi>'s beauty was not in exceſs,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48268:106"/>yet was it not far ſhort. Yet all this could not pervert <hi>Irlando</hi>'s thoughts, who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly glorious, applauded in himſelf how he was lifted up by his towring hopes to a heaven far more ſublime: He could not have prejudic'd his fortune by changing his propos'd election for all the treaſures of the world: yet on the other ſide, he fancies, thinking he might gain a greater liberty in his love with <hi>Roſalia,</hi> could his diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but be credited, as made to <hi>Emilia.</hi> The other remains ſo fully deceiv'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving theſe appearances; whence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he could not offend their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he deſigns to follow the waies of love with that Lady who wholly poſſeſt his minde.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Irlando</hi> advanceth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, before the other procures himſelf to be loved. He writes back to both the Ladies with a diverſe ſenſe, according to the pleaſure of his affections, or according to the little correſpondence of his minde. Thoſe he ſent to <hi>Roſalia</hi> were thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.</p>

            <p>Theſe Letters being ſeal'd, he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them onely with a mark, of which he gave the bearer notice which he was to give <hi>Roſalia,</hi> and which to <hi>Emilia.</hi> The chance was, that the ſervant either forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the marks, or miſtaken in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48268:108"/>in the delivery, betrayes his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will, yet not Fortune. <hi>Emilia</hi> looking on the letters which were written to <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> preſenting the readineſs of an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate correſpondence, was poſſeſt with the extremities of an unſpeakable joy; the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of her deſires, was the hight of her greateſt contentments which ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſhe could taſt at the table of earthly delights, with a perfect complacency, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe had gotten her own will, ſhe rejoyc'd in her ſelf in the ſublimity of thoſe conceits which might cauſe her to ſee her ſelf no leſs fortunate, then ſhe was reverenc'd.</p>

            <p>Theſe Characters had been much more grateful to the Gentleman, if as they were a bar to the felicity of his contentment, they had brought with them the end of his life; grief wrought not his death, it went farther, it ſtupified him. He eſteem'd this torment a puniſhment, for having treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly been lifted up with boldneſs on the foundations of her civility; knowing no other crime in him, but his ſpeed to run to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48268:109"/>the offer'd bait: He judg'd that this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rigour, was a pennance for having been contrary to the condition of her ſex, too liberal of her favours: He confiders that the efficacy of humility, the force of prayers and of conſpiracies might remove the ſiniſter influence of this his Star. Whereupon he reſolves, either with art, or with the importunity of prayers to gain admittance into her preſence, and then his tongue being animated with accents from the intereſt of his heart, would move the inſtances of an affectionate pitty. That very night he reſolves to have recourſe to the Tribunal of Love, where the juſtice of Reaſon would not be excluded; if they were not exalted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emilia</hi> in the mean time, by the ſtealth of chance, enjoy'd that proſperity which was the others due. In conformity to the order receiv'd in her Lovers Letter, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates <hi>Roſalia</hi> for that night to change houſes with her, and civilizeth the demand with the excuſe of an abuſive deceit hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to a Maid of hers. She obtains her deſire without oppoſition, which their friendſhip prohibited and the opportunity of gratifying requir'd. In theſe walls ſhe fancies that hight of enjoyment which her
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48268:110"/>thoughts expected from the embraces of a young Lover. All her Affections were vows directed to the Temple of Love, in gratitude for that proſperity which ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly favour'd her. Had time mov'd according to her importunity, hours would have fled like minutes rendred ſwift by the wings of her deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Irlando</hi> alſo with the air of his ſighs ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the Sun to take his lodging in the Sea, ſo that the ſucceeding obſcurity of the night might favourably bring him to <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> to quench her diſdain. He had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chimera's of puniſhments, fancy'd new forms of humiliations, extraordinary ſings of pennance, that he might laſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the requeſt of her loſt favour. He pants to get to that gate, on the threſhold whereof he reſolv'd to terminate the courſe of his life, could he not finde means for his hop'd for pardon. He goes to the very houſe of <hi>Roſalia,</hi> thinking that her diſdain would not have ſuffered her to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his demands, by the change he had intimated in his Letter.</p>
            <p>He was little leſs then ſtupified, when in appearance he ſeem'd deluded from the like fear, ſeeing himſelf curteouſly introduc'd by the ſervants, who as it ſeem'd had ſtay'd
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48268:110"/>long waiting for him, and hearing his name they preſently freely admitted him: which was by <hi>Emilia</hi>'s order, who impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, had ſent them to meet and receive him. He could not beleeve that ſuch like honors proceeded by their error of not knowing him; It being ſo, that the more they confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves in knowing him to be <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando,</hi> with ſo much the more curteous obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſs was he reſpected. At the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he made of the Lady, under the name of their Miſtris, he was anſwered, that ſhe expected him with troubles, for his ſtay had been intollerable, had he prolong'd the enjoyment of his preſence. He was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed within himſelf unable to conceive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of wonder equal to that accident, hearing atteſtations of love, when to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he had only received Characters of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of hatred.</p>
            <p>He then would by ſeveral replies be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, whether that were <hi>Roſalia</hi>'s houſe, he could not but beleeve himſelf deceiv'd, thinking it impoſſible, that he ſhould be come thither to receive favours, when he purpoſely came to beg pardon. When at laſt he was undeceived of all error, either from himſelf, or the ſervants, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to doubt leaſt thoſe incitements of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48268:111"/>ſecurity were not directed onely to betray him: He ſuſpects leaſt ſnares to revenge herſelf were hidden under that faign'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of love, and that heaven appear'd ſerene the more grievouſly to puniſh him with the thunder of her diſdain. Having pull'd up his courage, he went up the ſtairs, conſidering, that he ought not to abhor to fall a victim immerc'd in his own blood in her houſe whom he had ador'd.</p>
            <p>Being come to the top he meets <hi>Emilia,</hi> who taking him faſt by the right hand, without ſaying any thing to him, leads him alone with her into a Chamber. At this action the Gentleman had a greater occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ground his ſuſpitions. He with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doubted, that ſhe being offended by his refuſals, and thereupon out of diſdain had with the other conſpir'd his ruin. He condemns the fallacy of ſuch thoughts; when the door being ſhut, <hi>Emilia</hi> begins with ſweet kiſſes and affectionate embraces to expreſs the tenderneſs of her exviſcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted paſſion. His civility was confounded with theſe replicated encomiums, profeſſing to gratifie his favours; ſo much the more did theſe move <hi>Irlando</hi> to aſtoniſhment, not knowing what obligation of gratitude ſhe could have, unleſs ſhe was of his race, who
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48268:111"/>eſteem'd offences, and ſlights favours. The Lady ſeeing this ſullen ſtarchneſs in her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and appropriating the cauſe to a cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Nature, even to a chilneſs, ſhe thought to warm him with uſing the more carreſſes and courtſhips, the exhalations of an amorous fire. Yet he ſtifning himſelf the more at this heat, inſteed to liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a ſweet tenderneſs of heart, ſhe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with the iron of reproof to try of what ſtuff he was made, ſince he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately reſiſted the flames, which every way iſſued to fire him; ſince he neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the knot of her embraces, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the ſtrokes of her kiſſes, nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchang'd the words of her carreſſes. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſays ſhe, I am a <hi>Meduſa,</hi> ſince with the ſhield of my looks I change them who look upon me into ſtones? What novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty renders you inſenſible? What change renders you immoveable to my amorous effects? Did you then ſo curteouſly conſent to my invitation, and do you now deſpiſe the guift: Did you admit into the breſt of your civility my offers, and now do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the favours.</p>
            <p>Let it not invigorate your paſſion (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Irlando</hi>) that you ſee your ſelf depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of your preceded contents, ſince your
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48268:112"/>hopes are unjuſtly clothed with the ſpoiles of my affection; I am aſtoniſh'd, that the denials I ſent you in my Letters, adviſed you not what a correſpondence you might expect in the moſt evident expreſſions of love.</p>
            <p>What denials, ſays ſhe, (with the ſignes of aſtoniſhment) do you ſpeak of? what Letters? Rather becauſe I credited yours now I may ſay ſcorns, which before I thought the acts of a Gentleman, whom I have but too much favour'd. In ſaying ſo, ſhe ſhews him the Letter, which diſcovers the deceit to his underſtanding. In look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thoſe lines, which were paths of love, made for his heart to make way to <hi>Roſalia.</hi> Do you call theſe, ſaid the Lady, denials? Are theſe demonſtrations of love importunate and unfit? Alas, either the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance betrays the intention to have ſcorn'd me, or the pen in writing betrays the heart which refuſeth me.</p>
            <p>Afflict not your ſelf, Madam, ſays <hi>Irlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> as deſpis'd by me, who may rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as having been abus'd by Fortune. There is no crime in this, that your hopes ſhould riſe where the accompliſhment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſucceed. Mine was to give flight to theſe amorous Characters, that they might
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48268:112"/>neſt my affections in <hi>Roſalia</hi> boſom. Chance brought them to yours, which was his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to whom I truſted my Letters for their ſafe delivery. You are not therefore to think your ſelf offended, ſince he doth not deſpiſe the deſert of a Lady whom he cannot love, chiefly becauſe his affections are oblig'd to another. This paſſion natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally knowing no curb or rule, thinks it its property to run whether its genius or ſenſe inclines it: I am forc'd by your civility and love to be oblig'd to you, though I cannot be a Lover. Love, as an act of free will, knows no other laws but election. If this gratifie not your deſires, condemn Deſtiny or Cupid, and not me who reſpect and admire in you your admirable qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emilia</hi>'s thoughts being undeceived, ſhe oblig'd them to aſpire to another ſphere, for that there they could not fix the Center of their felicities. She lets him go, faigning a diſdain with all poſſible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that ſhe might not be ſeen in a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to beg a mans love. The Gentleman goes out of the houſe, thinking he went out of hell, where his ſtay every moment had increas'd new griefs. The cauſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready underſtood of the revolution of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia</hi>'s affections, had fixt in his thoughts
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48268:113"/>the recovering of the loſs of her love, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring her, that not his own deſpight, but the abuſe of Fortune had provok'd his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. He aſſured himſelf of regaining her favour, when from the quality of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſhe ſhould acknowledge the bonds of his ſincerity. Her fury not ſuffering her to attend to words, he determines to diſcriminate himſelf in a Letter, wherein he deſcrib'd what hapned by anothers, and not by his fault.</p>
            <p>Yet they came not in a proſperous time according to his deſires; <hi>Roſalia</hi> being ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by theſe recriminations to her beleev'd diſdain, at the coming of <hi>Armando</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe was perſwaded to give her ſelf with her affections to him; ſince by his refuſal, <hi>Irlando</hi> had already rendred himſelf unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving. To oblige theſe, ſhe conſider'd, that there reſplended more in him the conditions of a compleat Cavalier, and conſequently, that he more deſerv'd to be lov'd. Reſolving at laſt to employ her thoughts, which being kept idle, might perhaps reconcentrate again in <hi>Irlando,</hi> ſhe wrot for an anſwer to his, as followeth.</p>

Taking leave, he returns home, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to prove thoſe impatient longings, which oblig'd him to expect the evening of the following day, when he was to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his amorous converſation. He runs quickly to his friend, to whom he imparts the exceſs of his joy, relating the fortunate ſucceſs of his loves. He a great while holds him doubtful, jeaſtingly relating him, how kinde and curteous the Lady was, till at laſt he diſcovers her to be <hi>Roſalia,</hi> courted and admir'd mutually by them but a few dayes before. He ſhews the Letter wherein he receiv'd the invitation, conformable to which he ſwore the effects of her civility were.</p>
            <p>Its eaſier to fancy then to deſcribe, what conceits this relation produc'd in <hi>Irlando</hi>'s minde. Its to be beleev'd that the grief of his heart corroded his bowels, aſwel as it deſperately tore his heart in peeces. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the occaſion of all this, was onely the miſcarriage of the Letter, curſing him
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48268:114"/>that had been the cauſe of his torment. The certainty, which on the otherſide, his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved enjoy'd, was not an ordinary vexation, for one who exceſſively lov'd. He proteſted he was troubled with an inward grief of heart, that he might take himſelf off from the neceſſity of an affectionate congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the contentment of ſo good a friend. No leſs could faigning form effects of joy, where the heart was over whelm'd with the abundance of intollerable grief: His bed was all that night a hell, his ſoul being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in the confuſion of his turbulent thoughts, ſhipwrack'd his quiet, even in the depths of diſpair.</p>
            <p>The next day he reſolves to ſend a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the contents whereof were to ſignifie the injuſtice of thoſe chaſtiſements which the cruelty of his beloved inflicted; when he had never the leaſt way undeſerv'd her good graces. He was glad to make the ſincerity of his ſoul, appear in hope, that upon the knowledge of the truth, her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions would change. So it hapned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by the miſtaken counterſignes, <hi>Roſalia</hi> was aſſured that there was no fault in <hi>Irlando</hi> deſerving her diſdain; ſhe ſoon changeth her hatred into love, priding of it to have reacquir'd that happineſs which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48268:115"/>ſhe thought ſhe had loſt by his diſcurteous rigour. This change was nothing difficult, beſides, being neceſſitated by the proper volubility of her ſex, ſhe took occaſion not to be buryed, but onely aſleep towards him in affection. To have lov'd <hi>Armando,</hi> as they ſay, for a divertiſement, which yet hindred not the inclination of her heart, to him who firſt was poſſeſt of the Center. Whereupon ſhe thus writes.</p>

            <p>Theſe Characters chang'd the Scene both in the minde and countenance of the two Gentlemen, <hi>Armando,</hi> who gloried to have ſurmounted ſuch a felicity, ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at once caſt down from that hight whence he thought he could not have been remov'd, never thrown down, chang'd his mirth into an equal grief of heart and vexation; <hi>Irlando,</hi> on the other ſide, who being afflicted, tormented himſelf for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been too ſeverely us'd from her, who had authority to condemn his heart by a mortal ſentence; ſeeing himſelf invited to enjoyments, clears up with the ſplendor of ſo much contentment the heaven of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſcated minde, from the clouds of his grievous torments. A man might read in both their faces this change unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly caſt about, not known by what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Armando</hi> could not conceal his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, which proceeded from a minde full of grief; there came to light from his tongue, which feeding with a friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, with a long diſcourſe in diſpraiſe of the inconſtancy of women, he begins to publiſh the arms which had wounded him, till at laſt he diſcovers the wound which was the original of his grief. He ſhews
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48268:116"/>thoſe Charracters the unhappy meſſengers of his infelicity, and the foundation of his grief. He vehemently exaggerates againſt the treacheries of women, who faigning high exceſſes of love, at laſt diſcovered frauds and ſnares. Being at laſt carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the current of a grievous heart breaking, he flew into words, which came from the predominancy of his paſſion, till at laſt he concluded, that he would go to her houſe and reprove her for her treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if by the juſtice of his complaints he could not obtain the turn of her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt words the fortunate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man particularly obſerv'd; whereupon, that he might have no diſturbance in his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he adviſed his beloved of his rivals intention, ordring her to expect his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Emilia</hi>'s houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſalia</hi> at laſt relates to that friend of hers the entertainment ſhe had the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Armando,</hi> adding ſingular enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums of his grateful behaviour, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited even hearts of ſtone to love him. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi> whoſe memory repreſented to her the proofs of a rigorous ſeverity in <hi>Irlando,</hi> was quickly taken with ſuch like informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Her deſires approv'd thoſe effects,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48268:117"/>to felicitate themſelves with a moſt civil correſpondence, which ſuppoſing out of her former experience of the other, would ſurely be in <hi>Armando.</hi> The buds of ſuch a deſire could not but diſcloſe themſelves in her words; whereupon <hi>Roſalia</hi> making uſe of the occaſion, yeilded him for her ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for that night. The terms of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony wherewith ſhe refus'd that too cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous offer, could not ſtop the way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting the others thoughts, who faigning to ſatisfie her guſt, ſerv'd alſo her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. She brought her to the change a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of houſes, as where ſhe might enjoy him, who was by her commands oblig'd to com thither about two of the clock at night. She finally fits every thing in hope to make way to the deſpight of <hi>Irlando,</hi> by the favour of the other Gentleman, from whoſe civility ſhe pretended her heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning love would be aſſwaged.</p>
            <p>With theſe imaginary comforts ſhe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac'd her grief, whilſt with the aſſurance of real contentment, the other confirm'd her minde with her deſir'd conſolations. <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi> at laſt goes to her enjoyment; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando,</hi> at leaſt as he thought, to contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Both were civilly admitted, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſtoniſhment of the one, who
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48268:117"/>thought his admittance prohibited by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; ſeeing his way made plain by love. His heart leapt at this incredible novelty, which before was ſunk with diſpair: Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying a happy omen to himſelf, he thought to reſolve thoſe words in thankſgivings, which like clouds thickned with fury, threatned to fulminate reproofs. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Emilia</hi> forewarning him of a cheat renued the tumult of his thoughts; which afterwards conſpired to torment him; when having enquir'd after <hi>Roſalia,</hi> ſhe anſwer'd him, That ſhe was there in her ſteed, ſhe her ſelf having made the change. Hence ſhe went to ſpeak of love, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to act that perſon in all degrees of complacency which might ſatisfie a Lover. And thereupon with carreſſes and other love tricks, ſhe began to weave thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which alone captivate the ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Yet did his affection ſpume away, even thoſe powerful motives of ſenſe, obſtinately obliging him to continue his vaſſaladge to the others beauty, who although ſhe was ungrateful, yet ſhe did not forbear to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doreable; nevertheleſs the bridle of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration impos'd rules to this diſorder, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting as unreaſonable to deſpiſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ſo kinde a Lady, in hope to aſpire
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48268:118"/>to the others favours, who even loath'd him. So that with his genius, and with his conſent, he inclin'd to that part, which with reaſon predominated even to enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was not inferiour to his friend in running through the liſts of delight, whoſe bounds and carriere, were her fair breſts. Theſe two fortunate couple of Lovers will have no cauſe to envy one the other, both being equally in the road of contentemnt, if not of old of newer loves, and far more vehement affections. Thus <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando</hi> revolv'd the ſailes of their thoughts fitted to the wind, their hopes being already undeceiv'd to finde harbor whereto their deſires had at firſt ſteer'd. The diſpute of Rivalſhip being thus taken away, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of theſe Lover was free, between whom mutually there was a ſtrait knot of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Yet the flight of this liberty a freſh tranſports the affections to the ſhunn'd poſt of their election, <hi>Irlando</hi> loves <hi>Emilia,</hi> and <hi>Roſalia Armando.</hi> The cauſe of this change was, either the uſual property, to finde that loathſome which we have long enjoy'd, or the ordinary condition of our deſires, which alwaies more ardently aſpires to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that, which we may acquire by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving our ſelves of the other. Others
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48268:118"/>things ſeem alwaies better to us then our own; foraſmuch, as being oblig'd by our being to be alwaies content its neceſſary, that not vallewing what we enjoy, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what we ſee another poſſeſs; principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love, which the likeneſs of fire ſhews whoſe common condition is to aſpire to new objects.</p>
            <p>This element the greater nouriſhment it receives, as it were to glut the pride of its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, raiſing its flames ſo much the higher ſeems to demonſtrate the voracity of its appetite, greedy of making new prey.</p>
            <p>As novelties moſt delight, ſo the thoughts began to ſuggeſt hopes of more grateful felicities in theſe new Lovers. <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi> to whom theſe deſires ſhut the fight to the beauties of <hi>Roſalia,</hi> conſidered in the other the exceſs of ſuch a good grace, that it engrav'd in his heart the adorable idol of his affections. The Lady alſo who ſaw that <hi>Emilia</hi> was had in greater eſteem of <hi>Armando,</hi> whom ſhe thought far inferior to her in deſert, reſolv'd preſently ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love to him, who could acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it with the greater tribute of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>This change of their own wills was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited with looks, carreſſes, and jeſts, which
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48268:119"/>being the effect of a friendly union, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into affectionate accents. <hi>Emilia</hi> was ſatisfied with the behaviour of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and gave way to no thoughts which bore not the marks of her being conſecrated to him. Even <hi>Armando</hi> alſo remembring the great kindeneſs, with which his Lady at firſt confirm'd the exceſs of love before ſhe reveal'd it, had oblig'd his heart to preſerve his affections, that he could not mix them with thoſe which carried any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther image but that of <hi>Emilia.</hi> So that thoſe two loſt the field, being excluded from any correſpondency, who firſt of all entred loves Capital in triumph. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it amongſt themſelves, it ſeem'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for their luke-warmneſs was ſoon converted into coldneſs, and that into ice, ſo that at laſt diſdain and loathings ſprung from corrupt diſpoſitions, each of them thinking themſelves oblig'd to revenge the others infidelity, or at leaſt inconſtancy, which begot an exceeding hatred to para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel the puniſhment with the crime.</p>
            <p>The aſſaults were revolv'd againſt the true Lovers, who in oppoſition to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord rendred the indiſſolveable union of their affections the more ſtrongly fortified: mutually confeſſing their genius tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48268:119"/>out of the center of themſelves, and lockt up within the circumference of their amorous wills, agreeing to caſt off the love of their two friends, although to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. With faign'd fictions they perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the more highly to fix theſe roots in their hearts, which us'd to breed affectionate correſpondence, that jealouſie might not move the others to ſuſpend or prohibit them this commerce, wherein theſe rivals equally found acqueſt of enjoyments. Familiarity ſometimes permitted a kiſs to be ſnatcht, whereof theſe Lovers took an uſurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, conſidering the penury of other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The occaſion of a jeſt oblig'd a carreſs, and thoſe endearments without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending thoſe mindes with ſuſpitions, who thinking even that the others hearts were interchangeably knit, they doubted not that aſpiring to any other object, they would by their rivalſhip diſturb their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſalia</hi> at laſt being importun'd by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, with the more pleaſure to terminate theſe deceits, renders her friend jealous, with a faign'd jealouſie of her own. She ſeems to doubt that the Lovers being tir'd with their long poſſeſſion, were equally traytors of their oblig'd faith. She ſaid,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48268:120"/>that ſhe knew very well, that <hi>Armando</hi>'s minde was inclin'd towards her, as one the other ſide, ſhe perceiv'd her Lovers heart aſpire towards her. Being thus perſwaded to diſcover the proof of this truth, they ſhould one evening fraudulently exchange the Gentlemen: and by this occaſion, the liberty of amorous demonſtrations would diſcover to whom their affections moſt enclin'd. They promis'd one the other to revenge the the others offended faith with rigorous reproofs; when the vayl of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was taken off, and the ſtains of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery appear'd. The other being after this manner imbued with ſuſpitions, conſents to the experiment, to aſſure her ſelf of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of her pretended faithful friend.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Roſalia</hi> with <hi>Armando,</hi> and <hi>Irlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> with <hi>Emilia</hi> were in poſture to compleat the web of their own contentments, brought about by this cheat. The two Ladies one evening invited their two Lovers to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate treat every one at her own houſe. And afterwards by the ordinary change they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd the effects of their promiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſucceſs anſwer'd the deſign. The true Lovers being diſturb'd at the change, <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Armando,</hi> with ſigns but little grateful, ſoon ſtifled the others hopes. And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48268:120"/>made it appear, that the contentment of the minde was not pleas'd to change its ſphere, that it might not vary the motion of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. At laſt with all the art they could uſe, they could never ſtir that conſtancy, which being rendred invariable, knew no accident whereby it might overturn or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow it ſelf; So that leaſt theſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations might be converted into fury, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her or of diſdain againſt themſelves, they proteſted it was onely a miſtruſt of faith, expos'd to the ciment for that they doubted they wanted the triumphs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</p>
            <p>The beauties of <hi>Roſalia</hi> bluſht, finding that being proſtrate, they could not obtain love: Beſides, theſe bluſhes were acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd for ſigns, that her minde was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with remorſe, for a puniſhment of her being ſo changable, when another by the force of her beauty, and violenc of her carreſſes could not be perſwaded to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant. Warnd of her error ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects her thoughts and refixeth them on <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando</hi> to preſerve the quiet of her minde, by the immutability of her will. She conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the election made at another time on the valew of his grateful qualities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his not loving her, that ſhe was
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48268:121"/>rather inſatiable then voluble. Having at laſt fixt her reſolution, ſhe reſolves never to be mov'd by the impulſe of unbridled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. <hi>Irlando</hi> being aſſured of theſe thoughts, reſolves to keep her as the onely miror of his felicities, from whoſe looks alone he drew the image of his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He could not but glory in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſo fair a Lady, the life of whoſe glory drew breath from the air of the ſighs of thoſe who deſir'd her; correcting the error of his corrupted guſt, for having not eſteem'd what others Idoliz'd; he afreſh obligeth himſelf to her in an amorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, with oathes to maintain the knot undiſſolveable. Thus both theſe two cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Friends and Lovers, happily hung the vows of their own affections in the Temple of Faith, and erected an Altar to Love on the Pillar of Conſtancy.</p>

               <p>Epidoro <hi>a young</hi> Florentine, <hi>being deceived by a Masker, whom he beleeved to be</hi> Leena <hi>a Lady of honour, is found in the embraces of her Chamber-maid, and for his own ſafety is forc'd to marry her.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>TO enjoy the delights of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neval there reſided in <hi>Venice, Epido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> a young <hi>Florentine</hi> of a very mean birth, but his fathers avarice had gain'd him a kinde of reputation. He by the death of his progenitors was gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eſtate, which did not onely enlighten the obſcurity of his birth, but mov'd his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48268:122"/>deſires to the proſecution of thoſe pleaſures which are often long'd for by great ones. So that in <hi>Venice</hi> there was no publick feaſt, game, or recreation, whereto he did not come. One evening his heart was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſht by an imaginary, the dreſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of a Masker repreſented ſuch fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to his imagination, that he confeſt himſelf the lover of a face, before he had ſeen it; and the follies of his minde ended not there, ſo that having warily followed her as ſhe parted from the ball, he ſaw her go into the houſe of one of the prime Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the City, to whom amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which concurr'd to make him humanely happy, his wives beauty not a little contributed: It fell out in his thoughs, that the Masker muſt be <hi>Leena,</hi> forſo the Lady was call'd, which the more enflam'd him, and which the more invigorated his new deſires, he the next day knew <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> with ſome of the ſame garments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had ſeen the Masker adorn'd. The difficulty of the enterprize hightned his ſpirits which encouraged him to tempt all means; neither was Fortune wanting in ſhewing her to him; when the ſame eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Masker came to the Ball; he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been very officious, ſeeing no ſmall
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48268:122"/>correſpondence in her looks, the concourſe of the people not giving way to obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; tells her; Madam, Did not my tongue fear the crime of temerity, I durſt dicover the fire which is nouriſh'd in my boſome, and ſhould offer you the uſe of that love, which is the greater, the more hid it is. Did you know, anſwered the Masker, who was hid under this habit, your heart would repent what your tongue fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. My heart, Madam, replies <hi>Epidoro,</hi> bears no deſires, but from the knowledge of the deſert which your ſingular beauty hath begot. To gain the name of lover, then ſays the Masker, you care not to have the repute of a Glaſier. Tell me, How can you form a judgement on the beauties of that face, which you never ſaw but hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a vizard. A man may, replies afreſh <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> make a judgment of the Suns ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor although it be covered with a cloud. But my eyes too much force myheart to ſacriledge, by introducing therein the image of your beauty. Madam <hi>Leena,</hi> is it poſſible to hide the affection of a Lover who hath <hi>Arus</hi> his eyes, To ſay, I adore you, is the greateſt teſtimony that a mouth can utter, but the leaſt reſentmenta heart can expreſs. Its you may felicitate me;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48268:123"/>great undertakings are not without great difficulties. Love who can ſnatch the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even from the hands of <hi>Jupiter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, can make plain the very mountains of impoſſibility. He would have ſaid more had not the Masker, with ſome trouble, cut off his diſcourſe, by telling him, When you ſpake to me without knowing me, I bore with your ignorance, now knowing me with the greater preſumption of your boldneſs to tempt me, I cannot but blame your inſolence; Did I not fear to prejudice mine own honor, by having been a ſubject to ſubminiſter ſuch thoughts, ſo inferiour to my condition, I would cauſe your pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be the leaſt ill you ſhould ſuffer for you temerity. But whilſt ſhe uttred theſe words, her hand and her eyes betray'd her tongue, and aſſured <hi>Epidoro,</hi> by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible favours, that thoſe reſentments were endeavours of civility, and not effects of diſdain. Thus the Feaſtival ended, ſo that <hi>Epidoro</hi> was forc'd to retire with all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance which aſſault the youth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion of a Lover. Having expected the following night, which was the laſt of the Carneval, with all thoſe vowes which uſe to accompany the impatience of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous heart. Scarce did the ſtars begin
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48268:123"/>to glory of the light which they borrowed from the Sun, but he came to the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Ball: Not far from thence he meets the well known Masker, although with all art ſhe had thought to hide her ſelf from the curioſity of <hi>Epidoro.</hi> He taking her by the hand endeavours by theſe words to make her beleeve his affection. Fair <hi>Leena,</hi> you may by your change of habit deceive the eyes of other men, but never my heart, which by united means, and diffus'd heat to all my parts acknowledgeth, and adores you as a Divinity. I wiſh that with laſt nights garments, you may have depos'd ſome of your coyneſs, which rendred you ſo adverſe to my love: Know beſides, that cruelty is an improper attribute to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of your beauty, and beauty which is not communicable to all, oppoſeth it ſelf directly to the will of Heaven. Should Heaven replies the Masker, command me to love you, perhaps the laws of honeſty the danger of my life, and the inconſtancy of men would not be bridle ſufficient to the debility of my affections. The beauty of your looks, anſwers <hi>Epidoro,</hi> is a record of Heaven; which admoniſheth you not to be avaritious of its favours, when enriching you with beauty, it hath impoveriſh'd of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48268:124"/>praiſe the Faireſt conceptions. Lets forbear hiperbolies, replys the Masker; I as I know, I am not fair, ſo I could wiſh my ſelf ſo, that I might be the more grateful to thoſe that love me: but your craft, and my ſimplicity have made me depoſite my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in the heart of a perſon, who laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my folly, perhaps meditates how to deceive the felicity of my thoughts. I ought not to hazard my reputation to ſo evident a danger. I have ſpoken too much, were my face diſcover'd, my blood ſhould bear witneſs by my grief and repentance; the bluſhing my heart hath ſent thether are the reproofs of my ſoul, which threaten the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erity of thoſe chaſtiſements, the thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of which terrifies me. Saying ſo, ſhe retires amongſt the Maskers, leaving <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro</hi> in the hight of his thoughts, where a long while he would not have been remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if Love, who commonly is not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the neceſſities of Lovers had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him: ſo that having again taken the Masker by the hand, he ſo much entreated her, ſo much promis'd, that at laſt he gets leave to ſpeak with her the following night, which was the beginning of Lent, at a little window which lookt on an unfrequented ſtreet. With this hope he pleaſantly paſſeth
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48268:124"/>the reſt of the night, expecting the other with a thouſand imprecations againſt the ſtars for ſtaying ſo long from celebrating the obſequies of the day. Scarce had the light given place to the dark, but he comes to the appointed window; although he thought he had anticipated the hour, he findes himſelf prevented, his beloved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting him, accuſing him in her ſelf for want of love, that he had not prevented her. The complements which paſt amongſt them were many, and the amorous conceits numberleſs. They diſcours'd of conſtancy, fidelity, and ſeverity with ſo great an inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety, that the darkneſs ſeem'd weary to hear them, which even for the cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the light. The day comming they part, with promiſe to meet every time when <hi>Epidoro</hi> ſhould ſee a cloth hang at the grate, which ſucceeded twice or thrice a week, with ſo great a contentment to <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro,</hi> that in reſpect of that, all other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment ſeem'd but his anoyance: and then thinking that felicity full without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating the reſt, he grew to that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to truſt the mouth of many with the ſecret of his loves; he bragg'd that he poſſeſt <hi>Leena</hi>'s heart, who had made the patience and love of a thouſand Lovers
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48268:125"/>deſpair. He vaunted himſelf a poſſeſſor of that fair one, who had oblig'd to adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even thoſe minds which were incapable of love, unleſs it were that of themſelves. This rumor paſt from the ears of one, who fill'd with incredulity and envy would ſpy <hi>Epidoro.</hi> He hearkens to him one night, when he had appointed to get the poſſeſſion of the fruits of love. Having no patience to ſuffer the felicities of one, who was no waies his ſuperiour, by the favour of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; carried by envy, which conſpires al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies againſt the ſatisfaction of men, he vomits forth in a paper the effects of his madneſs, conveying it afterwards to <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s husbands hands. Opening the Note, he ſaw this written.</p>

            <p>This rais'd an infinite many thoughts in the minde of <hi>Cordelio,</hi> and all cruel; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was in his heart but blood, ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and murthers; yet being perſwaded by the love he bore <hi>Leena,</hi> and like a wiſe man, knowing the fruits of malice, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd all other teſtimony, but that of his own eyes. He faigns that he was haſtily call'd away by his buſineſs into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and parts not without <hi>Leena</hi>'s tears,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48268:126"/>who regreeted for every moment of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>Cordelio</hi> lay hid all the remainder of the day, and at night he goes to obſerve who it was that betray'd his honour. <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in the mean time had given her ſelf in prey to a moſt ſweet ſleep, not without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturb'd by her Nurſes voice; who told her, that <hi>Cordelio</hi> was to return in a ſhort time to the embraces of <hi>Ciniſſa</hi> her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid, and that ſhe her ſelf had told her ſo, that ſhe would not be her hinderance. <hi>Leena</hi>'s minde ſoon gave credit thereto; knowing her husbands genius, and her ſervants little honeſty; and the ſooner, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been before jealous, not without ſome affliction. She quickly clothes her ſelf, and would not be followed by the Nurſe, that with the more liberty ſhe might blame <hi>Cordelio</hi>'s inconſtancy. She goes neer her ſervants Chamber; and there ſhe meets her husband, who with naked ſword in hand, came againſt her to kill her: He did it not, either that ſhe might firſt ſee her Lovers death, or the pitty of Heaven permitted not that her innocency, although ſuſpected guilty ſhould ſuffer: <hi>Leena,</hi> though full of diſdain, yet thought intreaties fitter then reproofs for her own ſafety. Caſting her ſelf at his feet, mixing her words with her
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48268:126"/>tears, ſhe thus beſpake him. Sir, If the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt embraces of a ſervant pleaſe you more then thoſe of your wife, I oppoſe not my ſelf againſt your pleaſure, I would offer my ſelf to procure your pleaſures, would you but do me the honour but to command it me: but when with the loſs of my own due, I ſee my ſelf in danger of my life, I cannot but complain at the rigour of my deſtiny, which hath cauſed me to be born unhappy. The unbeſeeming diſhoneſty of a wench can then do more then the chaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of a wife, who hath no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires but thoſe which are ſubject to your beck. Alas, how hath <hi>Cordelio</hi> forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf? Alas, how hath Heaven, to torment me, chang'd the temper of the man? <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delio</hi> interrupting her, telling her, The falſeneſs of thy lips and tears, O thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent woman, would have introduc'd ſome perſwaſion in my heart, had not theſe eyes been witneſſes of thy diſhoneſty: Prepare therfore to dy, for 'tis unreaſonable that ſhe ſhould live, who hath prepared the funerals of my reputation. But firſt of all tell me, Where haſt thou hid that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wretch, who had the boldneſs to defile my bed. <hi>Leena</hi> being unable to ſuffer ſuch words as thoſe, which wounded the moſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48268:127"/>ſenſible part of her ſoul. Sir, To excuſe your amorous thefts make not my honeſty guilty with faign'd pretences; 'tis unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming your prudence, and my love; I am yours, and I am chaſt; Malignity and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy can finde no colour to criminate my thoughts, ſo far are my actions from wronging your honour. I appeal to your ſelf, whether the treacherous deſire of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying a ſervant, or the diſpleaſure of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been interrupted, have not now the poſſeſſion of your minde. <hi>Cordelio</hi> grew the more diſturb'd, and with violence askes her, of what maid, or of what love ſhe talk'd. Whereto <hi>Leena</hi> anſwer'd all what her Nurſe had told her, and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as much from her mouth alſo, he runs without delay to ſeek the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, and findes her in the wraſtlings of love, faſt claſp'd with <hi>Epidoro:</hi> He was going to ſacrifice them to his fury, but his wives perſwaſions diverted him. So that at laſt he was content, that <hi>Epidoro</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Ciniſſa,</hi> who was a ſervant, rather by the injury of Fortune, then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her birth. Whereto <hi>Epidoro</hi> without more to do conſents, the fear of death making him yield to any agreement. <hi>Cordelio</hi> then embraces <hi>Leena;</hi> excuſing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48268:127"/>himſelf of what he had done out of zeal to his own honor; having heard <hi>Epidoro</hi> call'd with a whiſtle from the grate, and ſeeing him afterwards introduc'd his houſ. <hi>Leena</hi>'s diſcretion was ſatisfied with theſe juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, glad to have eſcaped the danger, which was the greater being hid, which at the ſame time threatned both her life and reputation. This may ſerve to warn huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands not to run precipitouſly to ſuſpect their wives of unchaſtity. And to teach wives not to allow a treacherous liberty to their maids. And finally its an example to all thoſe who voluntarily ſeek to betray the honeſty of other mens wives.</p>
